<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="cap">THE schism of the Donatists, with which the treatises in
the present volume are concerned, arose indirectly out
of the persecution under Diocletian at the beginning of the
fourth century. At that time Mensurius, bishop of Carthage,
and his archdeacon C√¶cilianus, had endeavoured to check the
fanatical spirit in which many of the Christians courted martyrdom;
and consequently, on the death of Mensurius in 311,
and the elevation of C√¶cilianus to the see of Carthage in his
place, the opposing party, alleging that Felix, bishop of
Aptunga, by whom C√¶cilianus had been consecrated, had
been a <i>traditor</i>, and that therefore his consecration was invalid,
set up against him Majorinus, who was succeeded in
315 by Donatus. The party had by this time gained strength,
through the professions that they made of extreme purity in
the discipline which they maintained, and had gone so far,
under the advice of another Donatus, bishop of Cas√¶ Nigr√¶
in Numidia, as to accuse C√¶cilianus before the Roman
Emperor Constantine,&mdash;thus setting the first precedent for
referring a spiritual cause to the decision of a civil magistrate.
Constantine accepted the appeal, and in 313 the matter was
laid for decision before Melchiades, bishop of Rome, and three
bishops of the province of Gaul. They decided in favour of
the validity of the consecration of C√¶cilianus; and a similar
verdict was given by a council held at Arles, by direction of
the Emperor, in the following year. The party of Majorinus
then appealed to the personal judgment of the Emperor, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
was likewise given against them, not without strong expressions
of his anger at their pertinacity. This was followed
by severe laws directed against their schism; but so far from
crushing them, the attack seemed only to increase their
enthusiasm and develope their resources. And, under the
leadership of Donatus, the successor of Majorinus, their influence
spread widely throughout Africa, and continued to prevail,
in spite of various efforts at their forcible suppression,
during the whole of the fourth century. They especially
brought on themselves the vengeance of the civil powers, by
the turbulence of certain fanatical ascetics who embraced
their cause, and who, under the name of Circumcelliones,
spread terror through the country, seeking martyrdom for
themselves, and offering violence to every one who opposed
them.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Towards the close of the century, this schism attracted the
attention of Augustine, then a priest of Hippo Regius in
Numidia. The controversy seems to have had for him a
special attraction, not merely because of its intrinsic importance,
but also because of the field which it presented for his
unrivalled powers as a dialectician. These the Donatists had
recently provoked, by inconsistently receiving back into their
body a deacon of Carthage named Maximianus who had
separated himself from them, and by recognising as valid all
baptism administered by his followers. Hence they naturally
shrank from engaging in a contest with an antagonist who
was sure to make the most of such a deviation from the very
principles on which they based their schism; and, on the
other hand, Augustine was so firmly convinced that his own
position was impregnable, that he seems to have thought that
if he could only secure a thorough and dispassionate discussion
of the matter, the Donatists must necessarily be brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
to acknowledge not only their theoretical errors, but also
the practical sinfulness of their separation from the Church.
Throughout the controversy, however, he appears to have put
out of sight two considerations: first, the influence of party
spirit and prejudice in blinding men to argument; and,
secondly, the necessity of treating his opponents in a logical
discussion as on an equal footing with himself. The first was
in some degree an unavoidable element of disappointment;
but Augustine made concession yet more difficult on the part
of his opponents, by expecting them to acknowledge his
superior position as a member of the Catholic Church, whose
duty it was to expose the error of their views. He practically
begs the very point at issue, by assuming that he, and not the
Donatists, was in the Catholic communion; and though his
argument is conducted independently of this premiss, yet it
naturally rendered them more unwilling to admit its force.</p>

<p>This dogmatism was of less consequence in the first pamphlet
which Augustine published on the subject,&mdash;his <i>Alphabetical
Psalm</i>, in which he set forth the history and errors of
the Donatists in a popular form,&mdash;since it was not intended as
a controversial treatise, but only as a means of enlightening
the less educated as to the Catholic tenets on the question in
dispute. His next work, written in answer to a letter of
Donatus of Carthage, in which the latter tried to prove that
the baptism of Christ existed only in his communion, is
unfortunately lost; and we can only gather hints as to the
further part which he took in the controversy during the next
few years from certain of his letters, especially those to the
Donatist Bishops Honoratus and Crispinus.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> From the former
he claims the admission that the exclusiveness of the Donatists
proves that they are not the Church of Christ; and his letter
to the latter contains an invitation to discuss the leading
points at issue, which Crispinus seems to have declined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 400 he wrote two books <i>Against the Party of
Donatus</i>, which are also lost; and about the same time he
published his refutation of the letter of Parmenianus in
answer to Tichonius, in which he handles and solves the
famous question, whether, while abiding in unity in the communion
of the same sacraments, the wicked pollute the good
by their society.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Then followed his seven books <i>On Baptism</i>, included in
this volume, in which he shows the emptiness of the arguments
of the Donatists for the repetition of baptism; and
proves that so far was Cyprian from being on their side, that
his letters and conduct are of the highest value as overthrowing
their position, and utterly condemning their separation from
the Church.</p>

<p>Not long after this, Petilianus, bishop of Cirta or Constantina,
the most eminent theologian among the Donatist divines,
wrote a letter to his clergy against the Catholics, of which
Augustine managed to obtain a copy, though the Donatists
used their utmost care to keep it from him; and he replied
to it in two books, written at different times,&mdash;the first in the
year 400, before he was in possession of the whole letter,
the remainder in 402. To the first book Petilianus made an
answer, of which we gather the main tenour from a third book
written by Augustine in reply to it. It appears to have been
full of vehement abuse, and to have assumed the question in
dispute, that the existence of the true Church, and the catholicity
of any branch of it, depended on the purity and orthodoxy
of all its ministers; so that the guilt or heresy of any
minister would invalidate the whole of his ministerial acts.
Hence he argued that C√¶cilianus being the spiritual father of
the so-called Catholics, and having been a <i>traditor</i>, none of
them could possibly have been lawfully baptized, much less
rightfully ordained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>Augustine admits neither of his assumptions; but, leaving
the guilt or innocence of C√¶cilianus as a point which was
irrelevant (though practically the case against him utterly
broke down), he addresses himself to the other point, and
argues most conclusively that all the functions of the clergy
in celebrating the rites of the Church being purely ministerial,
the efficacy of those rites could in no way depend upon
the excellence of the individual minister, but was derived
entirely from Christ. Hence there was a certainty of the
grace bestowed through the several ordinances, which otherwise
there could not possibly have been, had their virtue
depended on the character of any man, in whom even an
unblemished reputation might have been the fruit of a skilled
hypocrisy.</p>

<p>The third treatise in this volume belongs to a later period,
being a letter written to Bonifacius, the Roman Count of
Africa under Valentinian the Third. He had written to
Augustine to consult him as to the best means of dealing
with the Donatists; and Augustine in his reply points out to
him his mistake in supposing that the Donatists shared in the
errors of the Arians, whilst he urges him to use moderation in
his coercive measures; though both here and in his answer to
Petilianus we find him countenancing the theory that the
State has a right to interfere in constraining men to keep
within the Church. Starting with a forced interpretation of
the words, "<i>Compel</i> them to come in," in Luke xiv. 23, he
enunciates principles of coercion which, though in him they
were subdued and rendered practically of little moment by the
spirit of love which formed so large an element in his character,
yet found their natural development in the despotic
intolerance of the Papacy, and the horrors of the Inquisition.
It is probable that he was himself in some degree misled by
confounding the necessity of repressing the violence of the
Circumcelliones, which was a real offence against the State,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
with the expediency of enforcing spiritual unity by temporal
authority.</p>

<p>The Donatist treatises have met with little attention from
individual editors. There is a dissertation, <i>De Aur. Augustino
adversario Donatistarum</i>, by Adrien Roux, published at Louvain
in 1838;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but it is believed that no treatises of this series
have ever before been translated into English, nor are they
separately edited. They are in themselves a valuable authority
for an important scene in the history of the Church, and
afford a good example both of the strength and the weakness
of Augustine's writing,&mdash;its strength, in the exhaustive way
in which he tears to pieces his opponent's arguments, and the
clearness with which he exposes the fallacies of their reasoning;
its weakness, in the persistency with which he pursues
a point long after its discussion might fairly have been closed,
as though he hardly knew when he had gained the victory;
and his tendency to claim, by right of his position, a vantage-ground
which did not in reality belong to him till the superiority
of his cause was proved.</p>

<p><small>HE PROVES THAT BAPTISM CAN BE CONFERRED OUTSIDE THE CATHOLIC COMMUNION

<p class="cap">CHAP. I.&mdash;1. In the treatise which we wrote against the
published epistle of Parmenianus to Tichonius, we promised
that at some future time we would treat the question of
baptism more thoroughly;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and indeed, even if we had not
made this promise, we are not unmindful that this is a debt
fairly due from us to the prayers of our brethren. Wherefore
in this treatise we have undertaken, with the help of God,
not only to refute the objections which the Donatists have
been wont to urge against us in this matter, but also to advance
what God may enable us to say in respect of the authority of
the blessed martyr Cyprian, which they endeavour to use as a
prop, to prevent their perversity from falling before the attacks
of truth. And this we propose to do, in order that all whose
judgment is not blinded by party spirit may understand that,
so far from Cyprian's authority being in their favour, it tends
directly to their refutation and discomfiture.</p>

<p>2. In the treatise above mentioned, it has already been said
that the grace of baptism can be conferred outside the Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
communion, just as it can be also there retained. But no one
of the Donatists themselves denies that even apostates retain
the grace of baptism; for when they return within the pale
of the Church, and are converted through repentance, it is
never given to them a second time, and so it is ruled that it
never could have been lost. So those, too, who in the sacrilege
of schism depart from the communion of the Church,
certainly retain the grace of baptism, which they received
before their departure, seeing that, in case of their return, it
is not again conferred on them; whence it is proved, that what
they had received while within the unity of the Church, they
could not have lost in their separation. But if it can be retained
outside, why may it not also be given there? If you
say, "It is not rightly given without the pale;" we answer,
"As it is not rightly retained, and yet is in some sense retained,
so it is not indeed rightly given, but yet it is given."
But as, by reconciliation to unity, that begins to be profitably
possessed which was possessed to no profit in exclusion from
unity, so, by the same reconciliation, that begins to be profitable
which without it was given to no profit. Yet it cannot
be allowed that it should be said that that was not given
which was given, nor that any one should reproach a man
with not having given this, while confessing that he had
given what he had himself received. For the sacrament of
baptism is what the person possesses who is baptized; and
the sacrament of conferring baptism is what he possesses who
is ordained. And as the baptized person, if he depart from
the unity of the Church, does not thereby lose the sacrament
of baptism, so also he who is ordained, if he depart from the
unity of the Church, does not lose the sacrament of conferring
baptism. For neither sacrament may be wronged. If a sacrament
necessarily becomes void in the case of the wicked, both
must become void; if it remain valid with the wicked, this
must be so with both. If, therefore, the baptism be acknowledged
which he could not lose who severed himself from the
unity of the Church, that baptism must also be acknowledged
which was administered by one who by his secession had not
lost the sacrament of conferring baptism. For as those who
return to the Church, if they had been baptized before their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
secession, are not rebaptized, so those who return, having been
ordained before their secession, are certainly not ordained
again; but either they again exercise their former ministry,
if the interests of the Church require it, or if they do not
exercise it, at any rate they retain the sacrament of their ordination;
and hence it is, that when hands are laid on them,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
to mark their reconciliation, they are not ranked with the
laity. For Felicianus, when he separated himself from them
with Maximianus, was not held by the Donatists themselves
to have lost either the sacrament of baptism or the sacrament
of conferring baptism. For now he is a recognised member of
their own body, in company with those very men whom he
baptized while he was separated from them in the schism of
Maximianus. And so others could receive from them, whilst
they still had not joined our society, what they themselves
had not lost by severance from our society. And hence it is
clear that they are guilty of impiety who endeavour to rebaptize
those who are in Catholic unity; and we act rightly who
do not dare to repudiate God's sacraments, even when administered
in schism. For in all points in which they think
with us, they also are in communion with us, and only are
severed from us in those points in which they dissent from
us. For contact and disunion are not to be measured by
different laws in the case of material or spiritual affinities.
For as union of bodies arises from continuity of position, so
in the agreement of wills there is a kind of contact between
souls. If, therefore, a man who has severed himself from
unity wishes to do anything different from that which had
been impressed on him while in the state of unity, in this
point he does sever himself, and is no longer a part of the
united whole; but wherever he desires to conduct himself as
is customary in the state of unity, in which he himself learned
and received the lessons which he seeks to follow, in these
points he remains a member, and is united to the corporate
whole.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ii.</span>&mdash;3. And so the Donatists in some matters are
with us; in some matters have gone out from us. Accordingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
those things wherein they agree with us we forbid them not
to do; but in those things in which they differ from us, we
earnestly endeavour that they should come and receive them
from us, or return and recover them, as the case may be. We
do not therefore say to them, "Abstain from giving baptism,"
but "Abstain from giving it in schism." Nor do we say to
those whom we see them on the point of baptizing, "Do not
receive the baptism," but "Do not receive it in schism." For
if any one were compelled by urgent necessity, being unable
to find a Catholic from whom to receive baptism, and so, while
preserving Catholic peace in his heart, should receive from
one without the pale of Catholic unity the sacrament which
he was intending to receive within its pale, this man, should
he forthwith depart this life, we deem to be none other than
a Catholic. But if he should be delivered from the death
of the body, on his restoring himself in bodily presence to
that Catholic congregation from which in heart he had never
departed, so far from blaming his conduct, we should praise
it with the greatest truth and confidence; because he trusted
that God was present to his heart, while he was striving to
preserve unity, and was unwilling to depart this life without
the sacrament of holy baptism, which he knew to be of God,
and not of men, wherever he might find it. But if any one
who has it in his power to receive baptism within the Catholic
Church prefers, from some perversity of mind, to be baptized
in schism, even if he afterwards bethinks himself to come to
the Catholic Church, because he is assured that there that
sacrament will profit him, which can indeed be received but
cannot profit elsewhere, beyond all question he is perverse,
and guilty of sin, and that the more flagrant in proportion as
it was committed wilfully. For that he entertains no doubt
that the sacrament is rightly received in the Church, is proved
by his conviction that it is there that he must look for profit
even from what he has received elsewhere.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. iii.</span>&mdash;4. There are two propositions, moreover, which
we affirm,&mdash;that baptism exists in the Catholic Church, and
that in it alone can it be rightly received,&mdash;both of which the
Donatists deny. Likewise there are two other propositions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
which we affirm,&mdash;that baptism exists among the Donatists,
but that with them it is not rightly received,&mdash;of which two
they strenuously confirm the former, that baptism exists with
them; but they are unwilling to allow the latter, that in
their Church it cannot be rightly received. Of these four
propositions, three are peculiar to us; in one we both agree.
For that baptism exists in the Catholic Church, that it is
rightly received there, and that it is not rightly received
among the Donatists, are assertions made only by ourselves;
but that baptism exists also among the Donatists, is asserted
by them and allowed by us. If any one, therefore, is desirous
of being baptized, and is already convinced that he ought
to choose our Church as a medium for Christian salvation, and
that the baptism of Christ is only profitable in it, even when
it has been received elsewhere, but yet wishes to be baptized
in the schism of Donatus, because not they only, nor we only,
but both parties alike say that baptism exists with them, let
him pause and look to the other three points. For if he has
made up his mind to follow us in the points which they deny,
though he prefers what both of us acknowledge to what only
we assert, it is enough for our purpose that he prefers what
they do not affirm and we alone assert, to what they alone
assert. That baptism exists in the Catholic Church, we assert
and they deny. That it is rightly received in the Catholic
Church, we assert and they deny. That it is not rightly
received in the schism of Donatus, we assert and they deny.
As, therefore, he is the more ready to believe what we alone
assert should be believed, so let him be the more ready to do
what we alone declare should be done. But let him believe
more firmly, if he be so disposed, what both parties assert
should be believed, than what we alone maintain. For he
is inclined to believe more firmly that the baptism of Christ
exists in the schism of Donatus, because that is acknowledged
by both of us, than that it exists in the Catholic
Church, an assertion made alone by the Catholics. But
again, he is more ready to believe that the baptism of Christ
exists also with us, as we alone assert, than that it does not
exist with us, as they alone assert. For he has already determined
and is fully convinced, that where we differ, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
authority is to be preferred to theirs. So that he is more
ready to believe what we alone assert, that baptism is rightly
received with us, than that it is not rightly so received, since
that rests only on their assertion. And, by the same rule, he
is more ready to believe what we alone assert, that it is not
rightly received with them, than as they alone assert, that
it is rightly so received. He finds, therefore, that his confidence
in being baptized among the Donatists is somewhat
profitless, seeing that, though we both acknowledge that baptism
exists with them, yet we do not both declare that it
ought to be received from them. But he has made up his
mind to cling rather to us in matters where we disagree. Let
him therefore feel confidence in receiving baptism in our communion,
where he is assured that it both exists and is rightly
received; and let him not receive it in a communion, where
those whose opinion he has determined to follow acknowledge
indeed that it exists, but say that it cannot rightly be received.
Nay, even if he should hold it to be a doubtful question,
whether or no it is impossible for that to be rightly received
among the Donatists which he is assured can rightly be received
in the Catholic Church, he would commit a grievous
sin, in matters concerning the salvation of his soul, in the
mere fact of preferring uncertainty to certainty. At any
rate, he must be quite sure that a man can be rightly baptized
in the Catholic Church, from the mere fact that he has
determined to come over to it, even if he be baptized elsewhere.
But let him at least acknowledge it to be matter
of uncertainty whether a man be not improperly baptized
among the Donatists, when he finds this asserted by those
whose opinion he is convinced should be preferred to theirs;
and, preferring certainty to uncertainty, let him be baptized
here, where he has good grounds for being assured that it is
rightly done, in the fact that when he thought of doing it
elsewhere, he had still determined that he ought afterwards
to come over to this side.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. iv.</span>&mdash;5. Further, if any one fails to understand how
it can be that we assert that the sacrament is not rightly conferred
among the Donatists, while we confess that it exists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
among them, let him observe that we also deny that it exists
rightly among them, just as they deny that it exists rightly
among those who quit their communion. Let him also consider
the analogy of the military mark, which, though it can
both be retained, as by deserters, and also be received by those
who are not in the army, yet ought not to be either received
or retained outside its ranks; and, at the same time, it is not
changed or renewed when a man is enlisted or brought back
to his service. However, we must distinguish between the
case of those who unwittingly join the ranks of these heretics,
under the impression that they are entering the true Church
of Christ, and those who know that there is no other Catholic
Church save that which, according to the promise, is spread
abroad throughout the whole world, and extends even to the
utmost limits of the earth; which, rising amid tares, and
seeking rest in the future from the weariness of offences, says
in the Book of Psalms, "From the end of the earth I cried
unto Thee, while my heart was in weariness: Thou didst exalt
me on a rock."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> But the rock was Christ, in whom the
apostle says that we are now raised up, and set together in
heavenly places, though not yet actually, but only in hope.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
And so the psalm goes on to say, "Thou wast my guide, because
Thou art become my hope, a tower of strength from the
face of the enemy."<a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> By means of His promises, which are
like spears and javelins stored up in a strongly fortified place,
the enemy is not only guarded against, but overthrown, as he
clothes his wolves in sheep's clothing,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> that they may say,
"Lo, here is Christ, or there;"<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and that they may separate
many from the Catholic city which is built upon a hill, and
bring them down to the isolation of their own snares, so as
utterly to destroy them. And these men, knowing this,
choose to receive the baptism of Christ without the limits of
the communion of the unity of Christ's body, though they
intend afterwards, with the sacrament which they have re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>ceived
elsewhere, to pass into that very communion. For
they propose to receive Christ's baptism in antagonism to the
Church of Christ, well knowing that it is so even on the very
day on which they receive it. And if this is a sin, who is
the man that will say, Grant that for a single day I may commit
sin? For if he proposes to pass over to the Catholic
Church, I would fain ask why. What other answer can he
give, but that it is ill to belong to the party of Donatus, and
not to the unity of the Catholic Church? Just so many days,
then, as you commit this ill, of so many days' sin are you going
to be guilty. And it may be said that there is greater sin in
more days' commission of it, and less in fewer; but in no
wise can it be said that no sin is committed at all. But what
is the need of allowing this accursed wrong for a single day,
or a single hour? For the man who wishes this licence to be
granted him, might as well ask of the Church, or of God Himself,
that for a single day he should be permitted to apostatize.
For there is no reason why he should fear to be an
apostate for a day, if he does not shrink from being for that
time a schismatic or a heretic.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. v.</span>&mdash;6. I prefer, he says, to receive Christ's baptism
where both parties agree that it exists. But those whom you
intend to join say that it cannot be received there rightly;
and those who say that it can be received there rightly are
the party whom you mean to quit. What they say, therefore,
whom you yourself consider of inferior authority, in
opposition to what those say whom you yourself prefer, is, if
not false, at any rate, to use a milder term, at least uncertain.
I entreat you, therefore, to prefer what is true to what is false,
or what is certain to what is uncertain. For it is not only
those whom you are going to join, but you yourself who are
going to join them, that confess that what you want can be
rightly received in that body which you mean to join when
you have received it elsewhere. For if you had any doubts
whether it could be rightly received there, you would also
have doubts whether you ought to make the change. If,
therefore, it is doubtful whether it be not sin to receive baptism
from the party of Donatus, who can doubt but that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
is certain sin not to prefer receiving it where it is certain that
it is not sin? And those who are baptized there through
ignorance, thinking that it is the true Church of Christ, are
guilty of less sin in comparison than these, though even
they are wounded by the impiety of schism; nor do they
escape a grievous hurt, because others suffer even more. For
when it is said to certain men, "It shall be more tolerable for
the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you,"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
it is not meant that the men of Sodom shall escape torment,
but only that the others shall be even more grievously tormented.</p>

<p>7. And yet this point had once, perhaps, been involved in
obscurity and doubt. But that which is a source of health to
those who give heed and receive correction, is but an aggravation
of the sin of those who, when they are no longer
suffered to be ignorant, persist in their madness to their own
destruction. For the condemnation of the party of Maximianus,
and their restoration after they had been condemned,
together with those whom they had sacrilegiously, to use the
language of their own Council,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> baptized in schism, settles the
whole question in dispute, and removes all controversy. There
is no point at issue between ourselves and those Donatists
who hold communion with Primianus, which could give rise
to any doubt that the baptism of Christ may not only be retained,
but even conferred by those who are severed from the
Church. For as they themselves are obliged to confess that
those whom Felicianus baptized in schism received true baptism,
inasmuch as they now acknowledge them as members of
their own body with no other baptism than that which they
received in schism, so we say that that is Christ's baptism,
even without the pale of Catholic communion, which they
confer who are cut off from that communion, inasmuch as
they had not lost it when they were cut off. And what they
themselves think that they conferred on those persons whom
Felicianus baptized in schism, when they admitted them to
reconciliation with themselves, viz., not that they should re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>ceive
that which they did not as yet possess, but that what
they had received to no advantage in schism, and were already
in possession of, should be of profit to them, this God really
confers and bestows through the Catholic communion on those
who come from any heresy or schism in which they received
the baptism of Christ; viz. not that they should begin to
receive the sacrament of baptism as not possessing it before,
but that what they already possessed should now begin to
profit them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. vi.</span>&mdash;8. Between us, then, and what we may call the
genuine<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Donatists, whose bishop is Primianus at Carthage,
there is now no controversy on this point. For God willed
that it should be ended by means of the followers of Maximianus,
that they should be compelled by the precedent of his
case to acknowledge what they would not allow at the persuasion
of Christian charity. But this brings us to consider
next, whether those men do not seem to have something to
say for themselves, who refuse communion with the party of
Primianus, contending that in their body there remains greater
sincerity of Donatism, just in proportion to the paucity of
their numbers. And even if these were only the party of
Maximianus, we should not be justified in despising their
salvation. How much more, then, are we bound to consider
it, when we find that this same party of Donatus is split up
into many most minute fractions, all which small sections of
the body blame the one much larger portion which has Primianus
for its head, because they receive the baptism of the
followers of Maximianus; while each endeavours to maintain
that it is the sole receptacle of true baptism, which exists
nowhere else, neither in the whole of the world where the
Catholic Church extends itself, nor in that larger main body
of the Donatists, nor even in the other minute sections, but
only in itself. Whereas, if all these fragments would listen
not to the voice of man, but to the most unmistakeable manifestation
of the truth, and would be willing to curb the fiery
temper of their own perversity, they would return from their
own barrenness, not indeed to the main body of Donatus, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
mere fragment of which they are a smaller fragment, but to
the never-failing fruitfulness of the root of the Catholic
Church. For all of them who are not against us are for
us; but when they gather not with us, they scatter abroad.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span>&mdash;9. For, in the next place, that I may not seem
to rest on mere human arguments,&mdash;since there is so much
obscurity in this question, that in earlier ages of the Church,
before the schism of Donatus, it has caused men of great
weight, and even bishops whose hearts were full of charity, so
to dispute and doubt among themselves, saving always the
peace of the Church, that the several statutes of their Councils
in their different districts long varied from each other, till at
length the most wholesome opinion was established, to the
removal of all doubts, by a general Council of the whole
world:<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;I therefore bring forward from the gospel clear
proofs, by which I propose, with God's help, to prove how
rightly and truly in the sight of God it has been determined,
that in the case of every schismatic and heretic, the wound
which caused his separation should be cured by the medicine
of the Church; but that what remained sound in him should
rather be recognised with approbation, than wounded by condemnation.
It is indeed true that the Lord says in the
gospel, "He that is not with me is against me; and he that
gathereth not with me scattereth abroad."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Yet when the
disciples had brought word to Him that they had seen one
casting out devils in His name, and had forbidden him, because
he followed not them, He said, "Forbid him not: for
he that is not against us is for us. For there is no man which
shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of
me."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> If, indeed, there were nothing in this man requiring
correction, then any one would be safe, who, setting himself
outside the communion of the Church, severing himself from
all Christian brotherhood, should gather in Christ's name; and
so there would be no truth in this, "He that is not with me
is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth
abroad." But if he required correction in the point where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the disciples in their ignorance were anxious to check him,
why did our Lord, by saying, "Forbid him not," prevent this
check from being given? And how can that be true which
He then says, "He that is not against you is for you?" For
in this point he was not against, but for them, when he was
working miracles of healing in Christ's name. That both,
therefore, should be true, as both are true,&mdash;both the declaration,
that "he that is not with me is against me, and he that
gathereth not with me scattereth abroad;" and also the injunction,
"Forbid him not; for he that is not against you is
for you,"&mdash;what must we understand, except that the man was
to be confirmed in his veneration for that mighty Name, in
respect of which he was not against the Church, but for it;
and yet he was to be blamed for separating himself from the
Church, whereby his gathering became a scattering; and if
it should have so happened that he sought union with the
Church, he should not have received what he already possessed,
but be made to set right the points wherein he had
gone astray?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. VIII.</span>&mdash;10. Nor indeed were the prayers of the Gentile
Cornelius unheard, nor did his alms lack acceptance; nay,
he was found worthy that an angel should be sent to him, and
that he should behold the messenger, through whom he might
assuredly have learned everything that was necessary, without
requiring that any man should come to him. But since all
the good that he had in his prayers and alms could not benefit
him unless he were incorporated in the Church by the bond
of Christian brotherhood and peace, he was ordered to send to
Peter, and through him learned Christ; and, being also baptized
by his orders, he was joined by the tie of communion
to the fellowship of Christians, to which before he was bound
only by the likeness of good works.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> And indeed it would
have been most fatal to despise what he did not yet possess,
vaunting himself in what he had. So too those who, by separating
themselves from the society of their fellows, to the
overthrow of charity, thus break the bond of unity, if they
observe none of the things which they have received in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
society, are separated in everything; and so any one whom
they have joined to their society, if he afterwards wish to
come over to the Church, ought to receive everything which
he has not already received. But if they observe some of the
same things, in respect of these they have not severed themselves;
and so far they are still a part of the framework of
the Church, while in all other respects they are cut off from
it. Accordingly, any one whom they have associated with
themselves is united to the Church in all those points in which
they are not separated from it. And therefore, if he wish to
come over to the Church, he is made sound in those points in
which he was unsound and went astray; but where he was
sound in union with the Church, he is not cured, but recognised,&mdash;lest
in desiring to cure what is sound we should rather
inflict a wound. Therefore those whom they baptize they
heal from the wound of idolatry or unbelief; but they injure
them more seriously with the wound of schism. For idolaters
among the people of the Lord were smitten with the sword;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
but schismatics were swallowed up by the earth opening her
mouth.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> And the apostle says, "Though I have all faith, so
that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am
nothing."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>11. If any one is brought to the surgeon, afflicted with a
grievous wound in some vital part of the body, and the surgeon
says that unless it is cured it must cause death, the
friends who brought him do not, I presume, act so foolishly
as to count over to the surgeon all his sound limbs, and, drawing
his attention to them, make answer to him, "Can it be
that all these sound limbs are of no avail to save his life, and
that one wounded limb is enough to cause his death?" They
certainly do not say this, but they entrust him to the surgeon
to be cured. Nor, again, because they so entrust him, do they
ask the surgeon to cure the limbs that are sound as well; but
they desire him to apply drugs with all care to the one part
from which death is threatening the other sound parts too,
with the certainty that it must come, unless the wound be
healed. What will it then profit a man that he has sound
faith, or perhaps only soundness in the sacrament of faith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
when the soundness of his charity is done away with by the
fatal wound of schism, so that by the overthrow of it the
other points, which were in themselves sound, are brought into
the infection of death? To prevent which, the mercy of God,
through the unity of His holy Church, does not cease striving
that they may come and be healed by the medicine of reconciliation,
through the bond of peace. And let them not think
that they are sound because we admit that they have something
sound in them; nor let them think, on the other hand,
that what is sound must needs be healed, because we show
that in some parts there is a wound. So that in the soundness
of the sacrament, because they are not against us, they
are for us; but in the wound of schism, because they gather
not with Christ, they scatter abroad. Let them not be exalted
by what they have. Why do they pass the eyes of pride
over those parts only which are sound? Let them condescend
also to look humbly on their wound, and give heed
not only to what they have, but also to what is wanting in
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>&mdash;12. Let them see how many things, and what
important things, are of no avail, if a certain single thing be
wanting, and let them see what that one thing is. And
herein let them hear not my words, but those of the apostle:
"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels,
and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a
tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and
understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I
have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not
charity, I am nothing."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> What does it profit them, therefore,
if they have both the voice of angels in the sacred mysteries,
and the gift of prophecy, as had Caiaphas<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and Saul,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> that so
they may be found prophesying, of whom Holy Scripture testifies
that they were worthy of condemnation? If they not
only know, but even possess the sacraments, as Simon Magus
did;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> if they have faith, as the devils confessed Christ (for
we must not suppose that they did not believe when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
said, "What have we to do with Thee? I know Thee who
Thou art, the Holy One of God"<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>); if they distribute of themselves
their own substance to the poor, as many do, not only
in the Catholic Church, but in the different heretical bodies;
if, under the pressure of any persecution, they give their
bodies with us to be burned for the faith which they like us
confess: yet because they do all these things apart from the
Church, not "forbearing one another in love," nor "endeavouring
to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,"<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
insomuch as they have not charity, they cannot attain to
eternal salvation, even with all those good things which profit
them not.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. X.</span>&mdash;13. But they think within themselves that they
show very great subtlety in asking whether the baptism of
Christ in the party of Donatus makes men sons or not; so
that, if we allow that it does make them sons, they may assert
that theirs is the Church, the mother which could give birth
to sons in the baptism of Christ; and since the Church must
be one, they may allege that ours is no Church. But if we
say that it does not make them sons, "Why then," say they,
"do you not cause those who pass from us to you to be born
again in baptism, after they have been baptized with us, if
they are not thereby born as yet?"</p>

<p>14. Just as though their party gained the power of generation
in virtue of what constitutes its division, and not from
what causes its union with the Church. For it is severed
from the bond of peace and charity, but it is joined in one
baptism. And so there is one Church which alone is called
Catholic; and whenever it has anything of its own in these
communions of different bodies which are separate from itself,
it is most certainly in virtue of this which is its own in each
of them that it, not they, has the power of generation. For
neither is it their separation that generates, but what they
have retained of the essence of the Church; and if they were
to go on to abandon this, they would lose the power of generation.
The generation, then, in each case proceeds from the
Church, whose sacraments are retained, from which any such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
birth can alone in any case proceed,&mdash;although not all who
receive its birth belong to its unity, which shall save those
who persevere even to the end. Nor is it those only that do
not belong to it who are openly guilty of the manifest sacrilege
of schism, but also those who, being outwardly joined to
its unity, are yet separated by a life of sin. For the Church
had herself given birth to Simon Magus through the sacrament
of baptism; and yet it was declared to him that he had no
part in the inheritance of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Did he lack anything in
respect of baptism, of the gospel, of the sacraments? But in
that he wanted charity, he was born in vain; and perhaps it
had been well for him that he had never been born at all.
Was anything wanting to their birth to whom the apostle
says, "I have fed you with milk, and not with meat, even as
babes in Christ?" Yet he recalls them from the sacrilege of
schism, into which they were rushing, because they were
carnal: "I have fed you," he says, "with milk, and not with
meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet are
ye able. For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among
you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and
walk as men? For while one saith, I am of Paul; and
another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?"<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> For of these
he says above: "Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing,
and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be
perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same
judgment. For it hath been declared unto me of you, my
brethren, by them which are of the house of Chl√∂e, that there
are contentions among you. Now this I say, that every one
of you saith, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas,
and I of Christ. Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for
you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?"<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> These,
therefore, if they continued in the same perverse obstinacy,
were doubtless indeed born, but yet would not belong by the
bond of peace and unity to the very Church in respect of
which they were born. Therefore she herself bears them in
her own womb, and in the womb of her handmaids, by virtue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of the same sacraments, as though by virtue of the seed of
her husband. For it is not without meaning that the apostle
says that all these things were done by way of figure.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> But
those who are too proud, and are not joined to their lawful
mother, are like Ishmael, of whom it is said, "Cast out this
bond-woman and her son: for the son of the bond-woman shall
not be heir with my son, even with Isaac."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> But those who
peacefully love the lawful wife of their father, whose sons they
are by lawful descent, are like the sons of Jacob, born indeed
of handmaids, but yet receiving the same inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> But
those who are born within the family, of the womb of the
mother herself, and then neglect what they have received, are
like Isaac's son Esau, who was rejected, God Himself bearing
witness to it, and saying, "I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau;"<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
and that though they were twin-brethren, the offspring of the
same womb.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XI.</span>&mdash;15. They ask also, "Whether sins are remitted in
baptism in the party of Donatus:" so that, if we say that they
are remitted, they may answer, then the Holy Spirit is there;
for when by the breathing of our Lord the Holy Spirit was
given to the disciples, He then went on to say, "Baptize all
nations in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted
unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
And if it is so, they say, then our communion is the Church
of Christ; for the Holy Spirit does not work the remission of
sins except in the Church. And if our communion is the
Church of Christ, then your communion is not the Church of
Christ. For that is one, wherever it is, of which it is said,
"My dove is but one; she is the only one of her mother;"<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
nor can there be just so many churches as there are schisms.
But if we should say that sins are not there remitted, then,
say they, there is no true baptism there; and therefore ought
you to baptize those whom you receive from us. And since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
you do not do this, you confess that you are not in the
Church of Christ.</p>

<p>16. To these we reply, following the Scriptures, by asking
them to answer themselves what they ask of us. For I beg
them to tell us whether there is any remission of sins where
there is not charity; for sins are the darkness of the soul.
For we find St. John saying, "He that hateth his brother is
in darkness."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> But none would create schisms, if they were
not blinded by hatred of their brethren. If, therefore, we
say that sins are not remitted there, how is he regenerate
who is baptized among them? And what is regeneration in
baptism, except the being renovated from the corruption of
the old man? And how can he be so renovated whose past
sins are not remitted? But if he be not regenerate, neither
does he put on Christ; from which it seems to follow that he
ought to be baptized again. For the apostle says, "For as
many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
Christ;"<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and if he has not so put on Christ, neither should
he be considered to have been baptized in Christ. Further,
since we say that he has been baptized in Christ, we confess
that he has put on Christ; and if we confess this, we confess
that he is regenerate. And if this be so, how does St.
John say, "He that hateth his brother remaineth still in
darkness," if remission of his sins has already taken place?
Can it be that schism does not involve hatred of one's
brethren? Who will maintain this, when both the origin of,
and perseverance in schism consists in nothing else save hatred
of the brethren?</p>

<p>17. They think that they solve this question when they say:
"There is then no remission of sins in schism, and therefore
no creation of the new man by regeneration, and accordingly
neither is there the baptism of Christ." But since we confess
that the baptism of Christ exists in schism, we propose this
question to them for solution: Was Simon Magus endued with
the true baptism of Christ? They will answer, Yes; being
compelled to do so by the authority of holy Scripture. I ask
them whether they confess that he received remission of his
sins. They will certainly acknowledge it. So I ask why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Peter said to him that he had no part in the lot of the saints.
Because, they say, he sinned afterwards, wishing to buy with
money the gift of God, which he believed the apostles were
able to sell.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span>&mdash;18. What if he approached baptism itself in
deceit? were his sins remitted, or were they not? Let them
choose which they will. Whichever they choose will answer our
purpose. If they say they were remitted, how then shall "the
Holy Spirit of discipline flee deceit,"<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> if in him who was full
of deceit He worked remission of sins? If they say they were
not remitted, I ask whether, if he should afterwards confess
his sin with contrition of heart and true sorrow, it would be
judged that he ought to be baptized again. And if it is
mere madness to assert this, then let them confess that a
man can be baptized with the true baptism of Christ, and
that yet his heart, persisting in malice or sacrilege, may not
allow remission of sins to be given; and so let them understand
that men may be baptized in communions severed from
the Church, in which Christ's baptism is given and received
in the said celebration of the sacrament, but that it will only
then be of avail for the remission of sins, when the recipient,
being reconciled to the unity of the Church, is purged from
the sacrilege of deceit, by which his sins were retained, and
their remission prevented. For, as in the case of him who
had approached the sacrament in deceit there is no second
baptism, but he is purged by faithful discipline and truthful
confession, which he could not be without baptism, so that
what was given before becomes then powerful to work his
salvation, when the former deceit is done away by the truthful
confession; so also in the case of the man who, while
an enemy to the peace and love of Christ, received in any
heresy or schism the baptism of Christ, which the schismatics
in question had not lost from among them, though by
his sacrilege his sins were not remitted, yet, when he corrects
his error, and comes over to the communion and unity of the
Church, he ought not to be again baptized: because by his
very reconciliation to the peace of the Church he receives this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
benefit, that the sacrament now begins in unity to be of avail
for the remission of his sins, which could not so avail him as
received in schism.</p>

<p>19. But if they should say that in the man who has
approached the sacrament in deceit, his sins are indeed removed
by the holy power of so great a sacrament at the
moment when he received it, but return immediately in consequence
of his deceit: so that the Holy Spirit has both been
present with him at his baptism for the removal of his sins,
and has also fled before his perseverance in deceit so that
they should return: so that both declarations prove true,&mdash;both,
"As many of you as have been baptized into Christ
have put on Christ;" and also, "The holy spirit of discipline
will flee deceit;"&mdash;that is to say, that both the holiness of
baptism clothes him with Christ, and the sinfulness of deceit
strips him of Christ; like the case of a man who passes
from darkness through light into darkness again, his eyes
being always directed towards darkness, though the light
cannot but penetrate them as he passes;&mdash;if they should say
this, let them understand that this is also the case with those
who are baptized without the pale of the Church, but yet
with the baptism of the Church, which is holy in itself,
wherever it may be; and which therefore belongs not to
those who separate themselves, but to the body from which
they are separated; while yet it avails even among them so
far, that they pass through its light back to their own darkness,
their sins, which in that moment had been dispelled by
the holiness of baptism, returning immediately upon them, as
though it were the darkness returning which the light had
dispelled while they were passing through it.</p>

<p>20. For that sins which have been remitted do return
upon a man, is most clearly taught by our Lord, in the case
of the servant whom He found owing Him ten thousand
talents, and to whom He yet forgave all at his entreaty.
But when he refused to have pity on his fellow-servant who
owed him a hundred pence, the Lord commanded him to pay
what He had forgiven him. The time, then, at which pardon
is received through baptism is as it were the time for rendering
accounts, so that all the debts which are found to be due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
may be remitted. Yet it was not afterwards that the servant
lent his fellow-servant the money, which he had so pitilessly
exacted when the other was unable to pay it; but his fellow-servant
already owed him the debt, when he himself, on rendering
his accounts to his master, was excused a debt of so
vast an amount. He had not first excused his fellow-servant,
and so come to receive forgiveness from his Lord. This is
proved by the words of the fellow-servant: "Have patience
with me, and I will pay thee all." Otherwise he would have
said, "You forgave me it before; why do you again demand
it?" This is made more clear by the words of the Lord
Himself. For He says, "But the same servant went out, and
found one of his fellow-servants which was owing<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> him a
hundred pence."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> He does not say, "To whom he had
already forgiven a debt of a hundred pence." Since then He
says, "was owing him," it is clear that he had not forgiven
him the debt. And indeed, it would have been better, and
more in accordance with the position of a man who was
going to render an account of so great a debt, and expected
forbearance from his lord, that he should first have forgiven
his fellow-servant what was due to him, and so have come to
render the account when there was such need for imploring
the compassion of his lord. Yet the fact that he had not yet
forgiven his fellow-servant, did not prevent his lord from forgiving
him all his debts on the occasion of receiving his
accounts. But what advantage was it to him, since they all
immediately returned with redoubled force upon his head,
in consequence of his persistent want of charity? So the
grace of baptism is not prevented from giving remission of all
sins, even if he to whom they are forgiven continues to
cherish hatred towards his brother in his heart. For the
guilt of yesterday is remitted, and all that was before it, nay,
even the guilt of the very hour and moment previous to baptism,
and during baptism itself. But then he immediately
begins again to be responsible, not only for the days, hours,
moments which ensue, but also for the past,&mdash;the guilt of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the sins which were remitted returning on him, as happens
only too frequently in the Church.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XIII.</span>&mdash;21. For it often happens that a man has
an enemy whom he hates most unjustly; although we are
commanded to love even our unjust enemies, and to pray for
them. But in some sudden danger of death he begins to be
uneasy, and desires baptism, which he receives in such haste,
that the emergency scarcely admits of the necessary formal
examination of a few words, much less of a long conversation,
so that this hatred should be driven from his heart, even
supposing it to be known to the minister who baptizes him.
Certainly cases of this sort are still found to occur not only
with us, but also with them. What shall we say then? Are
this man's sins forgiven or not? Let them choose just
which alternative they prefer. For if they are forgiven, they
immediately return: this is the teaching of the gospel, the
authoritative announcement of truth. Whether, therefore,
they are forgiven or not, medicine is necessary afterwards;
and yet if the man lives, and learns that his fault stands in
need of correction, and corrects it, he is not baptized anew,
either with them or with us. So in the points in which
schismatics and heretics neither entertain different opinions
nor observe different practice from ourselves, we do not
correct them when they join us, but rather commend what
we find in them. For where they do not differ from us, they
are not separated from us. But because these things do them
no good so long as they are schismatics or heretics, on account
of other points in which they differ from us, not to mention
the most grievous sin that is involved in separation itself,
therefore, whether their sins remain in them, or return again
immediately after remission, in either case we exhort them to
come to the soundness of peace and Christian charity, not
only that they may obtain something which they had not
before, but also that what they had may begin to be of use to
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XIV.</span>&mdash;22. It is to no purpose, then, that they say
to us, "If you acknowledge our baptism, what do we lack that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
should make you suppose that we ought to think seriously
of joining your communion?" For we reply, We do not
acknowledge any baptism of yours; for it is not the baptism
of schismatics or heretics, but of God and of the Church,
wheresoever it may be found, and whithersoever it may be
transferred. But it is in no sense yours, except because you
entertain false opinions, and do sacrilegious acts, and have
impiously separated yourselves from the Church. For if
everything else in your practice and opinions were true, and
still you were to persist in this same separation, contrary to
the bond of brotherly peace, contrary to the union of all the
brethren, who have been manifest, according to the promise,
in all the world; the particulars of whose history, and the
secrets of whose hearts, you never could have known or considered
in every case, so as to have a right to condemn them;
who, moreover, cannot be liable to condemnation for submitting
themselves to the judges of the Church rather than to
one of the parties to the dispute,&mdash;in this one thing, at least,
in such a case, you are deficient, in which he is deficient who
lacks charity. Why should we go over our argument again?
Look and see yourselves in the apostle, how much there is
that you lack. For what does it matter to him who lacks
charity, whether he be carried away outside the Church at
once by some blast of temptation, or remain within the Lord's
harvest, so as to be separated only at the final winnowing?
And yet even such, if they have once been born in baptism,
need not be born again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XV.</span>&mdash;23. For it is the Church that gives birth to
all, either within her pale, of her own womb; or beyond it, of
the seed of her bridegroom,&mdash;either of herself, or of her handmaid.
But Esau, even though born of the lawful wife, was
separated from the people of God because he quarrelled with
his brother. And Asher, born indeed by the authority of a
wife, but yet of a handmaid, was admitted to the land of
promise on account of his brotherly good-will. Whence also
it was not the being born of a handmaid, but his quarrelling
with his brother, that stood in the way of Ishmael, to cause
his separation from the people of God; and he received no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
benefit from the power of the wife, whose son he rather was,
inasmuch as it was in virtue of her conjugal rights that he
was both conceived in and born of the womb of the handmaid.
Just as with the Donatists it is by the right of the
Church, which exists in baptism, that whosoever is born
receives his birth; but if they agree with their brethren,
through the unity of peace they come to the land of promise,
not to be again cast out from the bosom of their true mother,
but to be acknowledged in the seed of their father; but if
they persevere in discord, they will belong to the line of
Ishmael. For Ishmael was first, and then Isaac; and Esau
was the elder, Jacob the younger. Not that heresy gives birth
before the Church, or that the Church herself gives birth first
to those who are carnal or animal, and afterwards to those
who are spiritual; but because, in the actual lot of our mortality,
in which we are born of the seed of Adam, "that was
not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and
afterward that which is spiritual."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> But from mere animal
sensation, because "the natural man receiveth not the things
of the Spirit of God,"<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> arise all dissensions and schisms.
And the apostle says<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> that all who persevere in this animal
sensation belong to the old covenant, that is, to the desire of
earthly promises, which are indeed the type of the spiritual;
but "the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit
of God."<a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>24. At whatever time, therefore, men have begun to be of
such a nature in this life, that, although they have partaken
of such divine sacraments as were appointed for the dispensation
under which they lived, they yet savour of carnal things,
and hope for and desire carnal things from God, whether in
this life or afterwards, they are yet carnal. But the Church,
which is the people of God, is an ancient institution even in
the pilgrimage of this life, having a carnal interest in some
men, a spiritual interest in others. To the carnal belongs
the old covenant, to the spiritual the new. But in the first
days both were hidden, from Adam even to Moses. But by
Moses the old covenant was made manifest, and in it was
hidden the new covenant, because after a secret fashion it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
was typified. But so soon as the Lord came in the flesh, the
new covenant was revealed; yet, though the sacraments of
the old covenant passed away, the dispositions peculiar to it
did not pass away. For they still exist in those whom the
apostle declares to be already born indeed by the sacrament
of the new covenant, but yet incapable, as being natural, of
receiving the things of the Spirit of God. For, as in the
sacraments of the old covenant some persons were already
spiritual, belonging secretly to the new covenant, which was
then concealed, so now also in the sacrament of the new
covenant, which has been by this time revealed, many live
who are natural. And if they will not advance to receive
the things of the Spirit of God, to which the discourse of the
apostle urges them, they will still belong to the old covenant.
But if they advance, even before they receive them, yet by
their very advance and approach they belong to the new
covenant; and if, before becoming spiritual, they are snatched
away from this life, yet through the protection of the holiness
of the sacrament they are reckoned in the land of the living,
where the Lord is our hope and our portion. Nor can I find
any truer interpretation of the scripture, "Thine eyes did
see my substance, yet being imperfect;"<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> considering what
follows, "And in Thy book shall all be written."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XVI.</span>&mdash;25. But the same mother which brought forth
Abel, and Enoch, and Noah, and Abraham, brought forth also
Moses and the prophets who succeeded him till the coming
of our Lord; and the mother which gave birth to them gave
birth also to our apostles and martyrs, and all good Christians.
For all these that have appeared have been born indeed at
different times, but are included in the society of our people;
and it is as citizens of the same state that they have experienced
the labours of this pilgrimage, and some of them are
experiencing them, and others will experience them, even to
the end. Again, the mother who brought forth Cain, and
Ham, and Ishmael, and Esau, brought forth also Dathan and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
others like him in the same people; and she who gave birth
to them gave birth also to Judas the false apostle, and Simon
Magus, and all the other false Christians who up to this time
have persisted obstinately in their carnal affections, whether
they have been mingled in the unity of the Church, or separated
from it in open schism. But when men of this kind have
the gospel preached to them, and receive the sacraments at
the hand of those who are spiritual, it is as though Rebecca
gave birth to them of her own womb, as she did to Esau; but
when they are produced in the midst of the people of God
through the instrumentality of those who preach the gospel
not sincerely,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Sarah is indeed the mother, but through Hagar.
So when good spiritual disciples are produced by the preaching
or baptism of those who are carnal, Leah, indeed, or
Rachel, gives birth to them in her right as wife, but from
the womb of a handmaid. But when good and faithful disciples
are born of those who are spiritual in the gospel, and
either attain to the development of spiritual age, or do not
cease to strive in that direction, or are only deterred from
doing so by want of power, these are born like Isaac from
the womb of Sarah, or Jacob from the womb of Rebecca, in
the new life of the new covenant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XVII.</span>&mdash;26. Therefore, whether they seem to abide
within, or are openly outside, whatsoever is flesh is flesh, and
what is chaff is chad, whether they persevere in remaining in
their barrenness on the threshing-floor, or, when temptation
befalls them, are carried out as it were by the blast of some
wind. And even that man is always severed from the unity
of the Church which is without a spot or wrinkle,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> who associates
with the congregation of the saints in carnal obstinacy.
Yet we ought to despair of no man, whether he be one who
shows himself to be of this nature within the pale of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Church, or whether he more openly opposes it from without.
But the spiritual, or those who are steadily advancing with
pious exertion towards this end, do not stray without the
pale; since even when, by some perversity or necessity among
men, they seem to be driven forth, they are more approved
than if they had remained within, since they are in no degree
roused to contend against the Church, but remain rooted in
the strongest foundation of Christian charity on the solid
rock of unity. For hereunto belongs what is said in the
sacrifice of Abraham: "But the birds divided he not."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XVIII.</span>&mdash;27. On the question of baptism, then, I think
that I have argued at sufficient length; and since this is a
most manifest schism which is called by the name of the
Donatists, it only remains that on the subject of baptism we
should believe with pious faith what the universal Church
maintains, apart from the sacrilege of schism. And yet, if
within the Church different men still held different opinions
on the point, without meanwhile violating peace, then till
some one clear and simple decree should have been passed
by an universal Council, it would have been right for the
charity which seeks for unity to throw a veil over the error
of human infirmity, as it is written, "For charity shall cover
the multitude of sins."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> For, seeing that its absence causes
the presence of all other things to be of no avail, we may
well suppose that in its presence there is found pardon for
the absence of some missing things.</p>

<p>28. There are great proofs of this existing on the part of
the blessed martyr Cyprian, in his letters,&mdash;to come at last
to him of whose authority they carnally flatter themselves
they are possessed, whilst by his love they are spiritually
overthrown. For at that time, before the consent of the
whole Church had declared authoritatively, by the decree of
a general Council,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> what practice should be followed in this
matter, it seemed to him, in common with about eighty of
his fellow-bishops of the African churches, that every man
who had been baptized outside the communion of the Catholic
Church should, on joining the Church, be baptized anew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
And I take it, that the reason why the Lord did not reveal
the error in this to a man of such eminence, was, that his
pious humility and charity in guarding the peace and health
of the Church might be made manifest, and might be noticed,
so as to serve as an example of healing power, so to speak,
not only to Christians of that age, but also to those who
should come after. For when a bishop of so important a
Church, himself a man of so great merit and virtue, endowed
with such excellence of heart and power of eloquence, entertained
an opinion about baptism different from that which
was to be confirmed by a more diligent searching into the
truth; though many of his colleagues held what was not yet
made manifest by authority, but was sanctioned by the past
custom of the Church, and afterwards embraced by the whole
Catholic world; yet under these circumstances he did not
sever himself, by refusal of communion, from the others who
thought differently, and indeed never ceased to urge on the
others that they should "forbear one another in love, endeavouring
to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
For so, while the framework of the body remained whole, if
any infirmity occurred in certain of its members, it might
rather regain its health from their general soundness, than
be deprived of the chance of any healing care by their death
in severance from the body. And if he had severed himself,
how many were there to follow! what a name was he likely
to make for himself among men! how much more widely
would the name of Cyprianist have spread than that of
Donatist! But he was not a son of perdition, one of those
of whom it is said, "Thou castedst them down into destruction;"<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
but he was the son of the peace of the Church, who
in the clear illumination of his mind failed to see one thing,
only that through him another thing might be more excellently
seen. "And yet," says the apostle, "show I unto you
a more excellent way: though I speak with the tongues of
men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as
sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> He had therefore
imperfect insight into the hidden mystery of the sacrament.
But if he had known the mysteries of all sacraments, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>out
having charity, it would have been nothing. But as he,
with imperfect insight into the mystery, was careful to preserve
charity with all courage and humility and faith, he
deserved to come to the crown of martyrdom; so that, if
any cloud had crept over the clearness of his intellect from
his infirmity as man, it might be dispelled by the glorious
brightness of his blood. For it was not in vain that our
Lord Jesus Christ, when He declared Himself to be the
vine, and His disciples, as it were, the branches in the vine,
gave command that those which bare no fruit should be cut
off, and removed from the vine as useless branches.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> But
what is really fruit, save that new offspring, of which He
further says, "A new commandment I give unto you, that
ye love one another?"<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> This is that very charity, without
which the rest profiteth nothing. The apostle also says:
"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance;"<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> each of
which begins with charity, and with the rest of the combination
forms one unity in a kind of wondrous cluster.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Nor
is it again in vain that our Lord added, "And every branch
that beareth fruit, my Father purgeth it, that it may bring forth
more fruit,"<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> but because those who are strong in the fruit
of charity may yet have something which requires purging,
which the Husbandman will not leave untended. Whilst,
then, that holy man entertained on the subject of baptism
an opinion at variance with the true view, which was afterwards
thoroughly examined and confirmed after most diligent
consideration, his error was compensated by his remaining
in catholic unity, and by the abundance of his charity;
and finally it was cleared away by the pruning-hook of
martyrdom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XIX.</span>&mdash;29. But that I may not seem to be uttering
these praises of the blessed martyr (which, indeed, are not
his, but rather those of Him by whose grace he showed himself
what he was), in order to escape the burden of proof, let
us now bring forward from his letters the testimony by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the mouths of the Donatists may most of all be stopped.
For they advance his authority before the unlearned, to show
that in a manner they do well when they baptize afresh the
faithful who come to them. Too wretched are they&mdash;and,
unless they correct themselves, even by themselves are they
utterly condemned&mdash;who choose in the example set them by
so great a man to imitate just that fault, which only did not
injure him, because he walked with constant steps even to
the end in that from which they have strayed who "have not
known the ways of peace."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> It is true that Christ's baptism is
holy; and although it may exist among heretics or schismatics,
yet it does not belong to the heresy or schism; and therefore
even those who come from thence to the Catholic Church
herself ought not to be baptized afresh. Yet to err on this
point is one thing; it is another thing that those who are
straying from the peace of the Church, and have fallen headlong
into the pit of schism, should go on to decide that any
who join them ought to be baptized again. For the former
is a speck on the brightness of a holy soul which abundance
of charity<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> would fain have covered; the latter is a stain in
their nether foulness which the hatred of peace in their
countenance ostentatiously brings to light. But the subject
for our further consideration, relating to the authority of the
blessed Cyprian, we will commence from a fresh beginning.</p>

<p class="cap">CHAP. I.&mdash;1. How much the arguments make for us, that
is, for catholic peace, which the party of Donatus profess
to bring forward against us from the authority of the
blessed Cyprian, and how much they prove against those who
bring them forward, it is my intention, with the help of God,
to show in the ensuing book. If, therefore, in the course of
my argument, I am obliged to repeat what I have already said
in other treatises (although I will do so as little as I can), yet
this ought not to be objected to by those who have already
read them and agree with them; since it is not only right that
those things which are necessary for instruction should be
frequently instilled into men of dull intelligence, but even in
the case of those who are endowed with larger understanding,
it contributes very much both to make their learning easier
and their powers of teaching readier, where the same points
are handled and discussed in many various ways. For I
know how much it discourages a reader, when he comes upon
any knotty question in the book which he has in hand, to
find himself presently referred for its solution to another
which he happens not to have. Wherefore, if I am compelled,
by the urgency of the present questions, to repeat
what I have already said in other books, I would seek forgiveness
from those who know those books already, that those
who are ignorant may have their difficulties removed; for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
is better to give to one who has already, than to abstain from
satisfying any one who is in want.</p>

<p>2. What, then, do they venture to say, when their mouth is
closed<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> by the force of truth, with which they will not agree?
"Cyprian," say they, "whose great merits and vast learning
we all know, decreed in a Council,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> with many of his fellow-bishops
contributing their several opinions, that all heretics and
schismatics, that is, all who are severed from the communion of
the one Church, are without baptism; and therefore, whosoever
has joined the communion of the Church after being baptized
by them must be baptized in the Church." The authority of
Cyprian does not alarm me, because I am reassured by his
humility. We know, indeed, the great merit of the bishop
and martyr Cyprian; but is it in any way greater than that
of the apostle and martyr Peter, of whom the said Cyprian
speaks as follows in his epistle to Quintus? "For neither did
Peter, whom the Lord chose first, and on whom He built His
Church,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> when Paul afterwards disputed with him about circumcision,
claim or assume anything insolently and arrogantly
to himself, so as to say that he held the primacy, and should
rather be obeyed of those who were late and newly come.
Nor did he despise Paul because he had before been a persecutor
of the Church, but he admitted the counsel of truth,
and readily assented to the legitimate grounds which Paul
maintained; giving us thereby a pattern of concord and
patience, that we should not pertinaciously love our own
opinions, but should rather account as our own any true and
rightful suggestions of our brethren and colleagues for the
common health and weal."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Here is a passage in which
Cyprian records what we also learn in holy Scripture, that
the Apostle Peter, in whom the primacy of the apostles
shines with such exceeding grace, was corrected by the later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Apostle Paul, when he adopted a custom in the matter of
circumcision at variance with the demands of truth. If it
was therefore possible for Peter in some point to walk not
uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, so as to compel
the Gentiles to judaize, as Paul writes in that epistle in
which he calls God to witness that he does not lie; for he
says, "Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before
God, I lie not;"<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and, after this sacred and awful calling of
God to witness, he told the whole tale, saying in the course
of it, "But when I saw that they walked not uprightly, according
to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them
all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles,
and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles
to live as do the Jews?"<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>&mdash;if Peter, I say, could compel the
Gentiles to live after the manner of the Jews, contrary to the
rule of truth which the Church afterwards held, why might
not Cyprian, in opposition to the rule of faith which the
whole Church afterwards held, compel heretics and schismatics
to be baptized afresh? I suppose that there is no slight to
Cyprian in comparing him with Peter in respect to his crown
of martyrdom; rather I ought to be afraid lest I am showing
disrespect towards Peter. For who can be ignorant that
the primacy of his apostleship is to be preferred to any episcopate
in the world? But, granting the difference in the
dignity of their sees, yet they have the same glory in their
martyrdom. And whether it may be the case that the hearts
of those who confess and die for the true faith in the unity
of charity take precedence of each other in different points,
the Lord Himself will know, by the hidden and wondrous
dispensation of whose grace the thief hanging on the cross
once for all confesses Him, and is sent on the selfsame day
to paradise,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> while Peter, the follower of our Lord, denies
Him thrice, and has his crown postponed:<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> for us it were
rash to form a judgment from the evidence. But if any one
were now found compelling a man to be circumcised after the
Jewish fashion, as a necessary preliminary for baptism, this
would meet with much more general repudiation by mankind,
than if a man should be compelled to be baptized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
again. Wherefore, if Peter, on doing this, is corrected by
his later colleague Paul, and is yet preserved by the bond
of peace and unity till he is promoted to martyrdom, how
much more readily and constantly should we prefer, either to
the authority of a single bishop, or to the Council of a single
province, the rule that has been established by the statutes
of the universal Church? For this same Cyprian, in urging
his view of the question, was still anxious to remain in the
unity of peace even with those who differed from him on
this point, as is shown by his own opening address at the
beginning of the very Council which is quoted by the Donatists.
For it is as follows:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ii.</span>&mdash;3. "When, on the calends of September, very
many bishops from the provinces of Africa,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Numidia, and
Mauritania, with their presbyters and deacons, had met together
at Carthage, a great part of the laity also being present; and
when the letter addressed by Jubaianus to Cyprian, as also the
answer of Cyprian to Jubaianus, on the subject of baptizing
heretics, had been read, Cyprian said: 'Ye have heard, most
beloved colleagues, what Jubaianus, our fellow-bishop, has
written to me, consulting my moderate ability concerning the
unlawful and profane baptism of heretics, and what answer I
gave him,&mdash;giving a judgment which we have once and again
and often given, that heretics coming to the Church ought to
be baptized, and sanctified with the baptism of the Church.
Another letter of Jubaianus has likewise been read to you, in
which, agreeably to his sincere and religious devotion, in answer
to our epistle, he not only expressed his assent, but returned
thanks also, acknowledging that he had received instruction.
It remains that we severally declare our opinion on this subject,
judging no one, nor depriving any one of the right of
communion if he differ from us. For no one of us sets himself
up as a bishop of bishops, or, by tyrannical terror, forceth
his colleagues to a necessity of obeying, inasmuch as every
bishop, in the free use of his liberty and power, has the right
of forming his own judgment, and can no more be judged by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
another than he can himself judge another. But we must all
await the judgment of our Lord Jesus Christ, who alone has
the power both of setting us in the government of His Church,
and of judging of our acts therein.'"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>&mdash;4. Now let the proud and swelling necks of the
heretics raise themselves, if they dare, against the holy humility
of this address. Ye mad Donatists, whom we desire earnestly
to return to the peace and unity of the holy Church, that ye
may receive health therein, what have ye to say in answer to
this? You are wont, indeed, to bring up against us the letters
of Cyprian, his opinion, his Council; why do ye claim the
authority of Cyprian for your schism, and reject his example
when it makes for the peace of the Church? But who can
fail to be aware that the sacred canon of Scripture, both of the
Old and New Testament, is confined within its own limits, and
that it stands so absolutely in a superior position to all later
letters of the bishops, that about it we can hold no manner of
doubt or disputation whether what is confessedly contained in
it is right and true; but that all the letters of bishops which
have been written, or are being written, since the closing of
the canon, are liable to be refuted if there be anything contained
in them which strays from the truth, either by the discourse
of some one who happens to be wiser in the matter than
themselves, or by the weightier authority and more learned
experience of other bishops, or by the authority of Councils;
and further, that the Councils themselves, which are held in
the several districts and provinces, must yield, beyond all possibility
of doubt, to the authority of universal Councils which
are formed for the whole Christian world; and that even of the
universal Councils, the earlier are often corrected by those
which follow them, when, by some actual experiment, things
are brought to light which were before concealed, and that is
known which previously lay hid, and this without any whirlwind
of sacrilegious pride, without any puffing of the neck
through arrogance, without any strife of envious hatred, simply
with holy humility, catholic peace, and Christian charity?</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>&mdash;5. Wherefore the holy Cyprian, whose dignity is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
only increased by his humility, who so loved the pattern set
by Peter as to use the words, "Giving us thereby a pattern of
concord and patience, that we should not pertinaciously love
our own opinions, but should rather account as our own any
true and rightful suggestions of our brethren and colleagues,
for the common health and weal,"<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>&mdash;he, I say, abundantly
shows that he was most willing to correct his own opinion, if
any one should prove to him that it is as certain that the
baptism of Christ can be given by those who have strayed
from the fold, as that it could not be lost when they strayed;
on which subject we have already said much. Nor should we
ourselves venture to assert anything of the kind, were we not
supported by the unanimous authority of the whole Church,&mdash;to
which he himself would unquestionably have yielded, if at
that time the truth of this question had been placed beyond
dispute by the investigation and decree of a general Council.
For if he quotes Peter as an example for his allowing himself
quietly and peacefully to be corrected by one junior colleague,
how much more readily would he himself, with the Council of
his province, have yielded to the authority of the whole world,
when the truth had been thus brought to light? For, indeed,
so holy and peaceful a soul would have been most ready to
assent to the arguments of any single person who could prove
to him the truth; and perhaps he even did so,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> though we
have no knowledge of the fact. For it was neither possible
that all the proceedings which took place between the bishops
at that time should have been committed to writing, nor are
we acquainted with all that was so committed. For how
could a matter which was involved in such mists of disputation
even have been brought to the full illumination and
authoritative decision of a general Council, had it not first
been known to be discussed for some considerable time in the
various districts of the world, with many discussions and comparisons
of the views of the bishops on every side? But this
is one effect of the soundness of peace, that when any doubtful
points are long under investigation, and when, on account of
the difficulty of arriving at the truth, they produce difference of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
opinion in the course of brotherly disputation, till men at last
arrive at the unalloyed truth; yet the bond of unity remains,
lest in the part that is cut away there should be found the
incurable wound of deadly error.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>&mdash;6. And so it is that often something is imperfectly
revealed to the more learned, that their patient and
humble charity, from which proceeds the greater fruit, may
be proved, either in the way in which they preserve unity,
when they hold different opinions on matters of comparative
obscurity, or in the temper with which they receive the truth,
when they learn that it has been declared to be contrary to
what they thought. And of these two we have a manifestation
in the blessed Cyprian of the one, viz. of the way in which
he preserved unity with those from whom he differed in
opinion. For he says, "Judging no one, nor depriving any
one of the right of communion if he differ from us."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> And
the other, viz. in what temper he could receive the truth
when found to be different from what he thought it, though
his letters are silent on the point, is yet proclaimed by his
merits. If there is no letter extant to prove it, it is witnessed
by his crown of martyrdom; if the Council of bishops declare
it not, it is declared by the host of angels. For it is no small
proof of a most peaceful soul, that he won the crown of martyrdom
in that unity from which he would not separate, even
though he differed from it. For we are but men; and it is
therefore a temptation incident to men that we should hold
views at variance with the truth on any point. But to come
through too great love for our own opinion, or through jealousy
of our betters, even to the sacrilege of dividing the communion
of the Church, and of founding heresy or schism, is a presumption
worthy of the devil. But never in any point to entertain
an opinion at variance with the truth is perfection found only
in the angels. Since then we are men, yet forasmuch as in
hope we are angels, whose equals we shall be in the resurrection,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
at any rate, so long as we are wanting in the perfection
of angels, let us at least be without the presumption of the
devil. Accordingly the apostle says, "There hath no tempta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>tion
taken you but such as is common to man."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> It is therefore
part of man's nature to be sometimes wrong. Wherefore
he says in another place, "Let us therefore, as many as are
perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye be otherwise
minded, God shall reveal even this unto you."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> But to whom
does He reveal it when it is His will (be it in this life or in
the life to come), save to those who walk in the way of peace,
and stray not aside into any schism? Not to such as those
who have not known the way of peace,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> or for some other
cause have broken the bond of unity. And so, when the
apostle said, "And if in anything ye be otherwise minded,
God shall reveal even this unto you," lest they should think
that besides the way of peace their own wrong views might
be revealed to them, he immediately added, "Nevertheless,
whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same
rule."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> And Cyprian, walking by this rule, by the most persistent
tolerance, not simply by the shedding of his blood, but
because it was shed in unity (for if he gave his body to be
burned, and had not charity, it would profit him nothing<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>),
came by the confession of martyrdom to the light of the angels,
and if not before, at least then, acknowledged the revelation of
the truth on that point on which, while yet in error, he did
not prefer the maintenance of a wrong opinion to the bond of
unity.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>&mdash;7. What then, ye Donatists, what have ye to say
to this? If our opinion about baptism is true, yet all who
thought differently in the time of Cyprian were not cut off
from the unity of the Church, till God revealed to them the
truth of the point on which they were in error, why then
have ye by your sacrilegious separation broken the bond of
peace? But if yours is the true opinion about baptism,
Cyprian and the others, in conjunction with whom ye set forth
that he held such a Council, remained in unity with those who
thought otherwise; why, therefore, have ye broken the bond
of peace? Choose which alternative ye will, ye are compelled
to pronounce an opinion against your schism. Answer me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
wherefore have ye separated yourselves? Wherefore have ye
erected an altar in opposition to the whole world? Wherefore
do ye not communicate with the Churches to which apostolic
epistles have been sent, which you yourselves read and acknowledge,
in accordance with whose tenor you say that you order
your lives? Answer me, wherefore have ye separated yourselves?
I suppose in order that ye might not perish by
communion with wicked men. How then was it that Cyprian,
and so many of his colleagues, did not perish? For though
they believed that heretics and schismatics did not possess
baptism, yet they chose rather to hold communion with them
when they had been received into the Church without baptism,
although they believed that their flagrant and sacrilegious
sins were yet upon their heads, than to be separated
from the unity of the Church, according to the words of
Cyprian, "Judging no one, nor depriving any one of the right
of communion if he differ from us."</p>

<p>8. If, therefore, by such communion with the wicked the
just cannot but perish, the Church had already perished in the
time of Cyprian. Whence then sprang the origin of Donatus?
where was he taught, where was he baptized, where was he
ordained, since the Church had been already destroyed by the
contagion of communion with the wicked? But if the Church
still existed, the wicked could do no harm to the good in one
communion with them. Wherefore did ye separate yourselves?
Behold, I see in unity Cyprian and others, his
colleagues, who, on holding a council, decided that those who
have been baptized without the communion of the Church
have no true baptism, and that therefore it must be given
them when they join the Church. But again, behold I see
in the same unity that certain men think differently in this
matter, and that, recognising in those who come from heretics
and schismatics the baptism of Christ, they do not venture to
baptize them afresh. All of these catholic unity embraces in
her motherly breast, bearing each other's burdens by turns,
and endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond
of peace,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> till God should reveal to one or other of them any
error in their views. If the one party held the truth, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
they infected by the others, or no? If the others held the
truth, were they infected by the first, or no? Choose which
ye will. If there was contamination, the Church even then
ceased to exist; answer me, therefore, whence came ye forth
hither? But if the Church remained, the good are in no wise
contaminated by the bad in such communion; answer me,
therefore, why did ye break the bond?</p>

<p>9. Or is it perhaps that schismatics, when received without
baptism, bring no infection, but that it is brought by those
who deliver up the sacred books?<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> For that there were
<i>traditors</i> of your number is proved by the clearest testimony
of history. And if you had then brought true evidence
against those whom you were accusing, you would have proved
your cause before the unity of the whole world, so that you
would have been retained whilst they were shut out. And if
you endeavoured to do this, and did not succeed, the world is
not to blame, which trusted the judges of the Church rather
than the beaten parties in the suit; whilst, if you would not
urge your suit, the world again is not to blame, which could
not condemn men without their cause being heard. Why,
then, did you separate yourselves from the innocent? You
cannot defend the sacrilege of your schism. But this I pass
over. But so much I say, that if the <i>traditors</i> could have
defiled you, who were not convicted by you, and by whom, on
the contrary, you were beaten, much more could the sacrilege
of schismatics and heretics, received into the Church, as you
maintain, without baptism, have defiled Cyprian. Yet he did
not separate himself. And inasmuch as the Church continued
to exist, it is clear that it could not be defiled.
Wherefore, then, did you separate yourselves, I do not say
from the innocent, as the facts proved them, but from the
<i>traditors</i>, as they were never proved to be? Are the sins
of <i>traditors</i>, as I began to say, heavier than those of schismatics?
Let us not bring in deceitful balances, to which we
may hang what weights we will, and how we will, saying to
suit ourselves, "This is heavy and this is light;" but let us
bring forward the sacred balance out of holy Scripture, as
out of the Lord's treasure-house, and let us weigh them by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
it, to see which is the heavier; or rather, let us not weigh
them for ourselves, but read the weights as declared by the
Lord. At the time when the Lord showed, by the example
of recent punishment, that there was need to guard against
the sins of olden days, and an idol was made and worshipped,
and the prophetic book was burned by the wrath of a scoffing
king, and schism was attempted, the idolatry was punished
with the sword,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> the burning of the book by slaughter in war
and captivity in a foreign land,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> schism by the earth opening,
and swallowing up alive the leaders of the schism, while the
rest were consumed with fire from heaven.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Who will now
doubt that that was the worse crime which received the
heavier punishment? If men coming from such sacrilegious
company, without baptism, as you maintain, could not defile
Cyprian, how could those defile you who were not convicted
but supposed betrayers of the sacred books?<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> For if they had
not only given up the books to be burned, but had actually
burned them with their own hands, they would have been guilty
of a less sin than if they had committed schism; for schism is
visited with the heavier, the other with the lighter punishment,
not at man's discretion, but by the judgment of God.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span>&mdash;10. Wherefore, then, have ye severed yourselves?
If there is any sense left in you, you must surely
see that you can find no possible answer to these arguments.
"We are not left," they say, "so utterly without resource, but
that we can still answer, It is our will. 'Who art thou that
judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth
or falleth.'"<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> They do not understand that this was said to
men who were wishing to judge, not of open facts, but of the
hearts of other men. For how does the apostle himself come
to say so much about the sins of schisms and heresies? Or
how comes that verse in the Psalms, "If of a truth ye love
justice, judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?"<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> But why does
the Lord Himself say, "Judge not according to the appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>ance,
but judge righteous judgment,"<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> if we may not judge
any man? Lastly, why, in the case of those <i>traditors</i>, whom
they have judged unrighteously, have they themselves ventured
to pass any judgments at all on another man's servants? To
their own master they were standing or falling. Or why, in
the case of the recent followers of Maximianus, have they not
hesitated to bring forward the judgment delivered with the
infallible voice, as they aver, of a general Council, in such
terms as to compare them with those first schismatics whom
the earth swallowed up alive? And yet some of them, as
they cannot deny, they either condemned though innocent, or
received back again in their guilt. But when a truth is
urged which they cannot gainsay, they mutter a truly wholesome
murmuring: "It is our will: 'Who art thou that judgest
another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or
falleth.'" But when a weak sheep is espied in the desert, and
the pastor who should reclaim it to the fold is nowhere to be
seen, then there is setting of teeth, and breaking of the weak
neck: "Thou wouldst be a good man, wert thou not a <i>traditor</i>.
Consult the welfare of thy soul; be a Christian." What unconscionable
madness! When it is said to a Christian, "Be a
Christian," what other lesson is taught, save a denial that he
is a Christian? Was it not the same lesson which those persecutors
of the Christians wished to teach, by resisting whom
the crown of martyrdom was gained? Or must we even look
on crime as lighter when committed with threatening of the
sword than with treachery of the tongue?</p>

<p>11. Answer me this, ye ravening wolves, who, seeking to
be clad in sheep's clothing,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> think that the letters of the
blessed Cyprian are in your favour. Did the sacrilege of schismatics
defile Cyprian, or did it not? If it did, the Church
perished from that instant, and there remained no source from
which ye might spring. If it did not, then by what offence
on the part of others can the guiltless possibly be denied, if
the sacrilege of schism cannot defile them? Wherefore, then,
have ye severed yourselves? Wherefore, while shunning the
lighter offences, which are inventions of your own, have ye
committed the heaviest offence of all, the sacrilege of schism?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Will ye now perchance confess that those men were no longer
schismatics or heretics who had been baptized without the
communion of the Church, or in some heresy or schism, because
by coming over to the Church, and renouncing their
former errors, they had ceased to be what formerly they were?
How then was it, that though they were not baptized, their
sins remained not on their heads? Was it that the baptism
was Christ's, but that it could not profit them without the
communion of the Church; yet when they came over, and,
renouncing their past error, were received into the communion
of the Church by the laying on of hands, then, being now
rooted and founded in charity, without which all other things
are profitless, they began to receive profit for the remission of
sins and the sanctification of their lives from that sacrament,
which, while without the pale of the Church, they possessed
in vain?</p>

<p>12. Cease, then, to bring forward against us the authority
of Cyprian in favour of repeating baptism, but cling with us
to the example of Cyprian for the preservation of unity. For
this question of baptism had not been as yet completely
worked out, but yet the Church observed the most wholesome
custom of correcting what was wrong, not repeating what was
already given, even in the case of schismatics and heretics:
she healed the wounded part, but did not meddle with what
was whole. And this custom, coming, I suppose, from apostolical
tradition (like many other things which are held to
have been handed down under their actual sanction, because
they are preserved throughout the whole Church, though they
are not found either in their letters, or in the Councils of their
successors),&mdash;this most wholesome custom, I say, according to
the holy Cyprian, began to be what is called amended by his
predecessor Agrippinus. But, according to the teaching which
springs from a more careful investigation into the truth, which,
after great doubt and fluctuation, was brought at last to the decision
of a general Council, we ought to believe that it rather
began to be corrupted than to receive correction at the hands
of Agrippinus. Accordingly, when so great a question forced
itself upon him, and it was difficult to decide the point,
whether remission of sins and man's spiritual regeneration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
could take place among heretics or schismatics, and the authority
of Agrippinus was there to guide him, with that of some
few men who shared in his misapprehension of this question,
having preferred attempting something new to maintaining a
custom which they did not understand how to defend; under
these circumstances, considerations of probability forced themselves
into the eyes of his soul, and barred the way to the
thorough investigation of the truth.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. viii.</span>&mdash;13. Nor do I think that the blessed Cyprian
had any other motive in the free expression and earlier utterance
of what he thought in opposition to the custom of the
Church, save that he should thankfully receive any one that
could be found with a fuller revelation of the truth, and that
he should show forth a pattern for imitation, not only of diligence
in teaching, but also of modesty in learning; but that,
if no one should be found to bring forward any argument by
which those considerations of probability should be refuted,
then he should abide by his opinion, with the full consciousness
that he had neither concealed what he conceived to be the
truth, nor violated the unity which he loved. For so he understood
the words of the apostle: "Let the prophets speak two
or three, and let the other judge. If anything be revealed
to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> "In
which passage he has taught and shown, that many things are
revealed to individuals for the better, and that we ought not
each to strive pertinaciously for what he has once imbibed and
held, but if anything has appeared better and more useful, he
should willingly embrace it."<a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> At any rate, in these words
he not only advised those to agree with him who saw no better
course, but also exhorted any who could to bring forward arguments
by which the maintenance of the former custom might
rather be established; that if they should be of such a nature
as not to admit of refutation, he might show in his own person
with what sincerity he said "that we ought not each to strive
pertinaciously for what he has once imbibed and held, but that,
if anything has appeared better and more useful, he should
willingly embrace it."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> But inasmuch as none appeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
except such as simply urged the custom against him, and the
arguments which they produced in its favour were not of a
kind to bring conviction to a soul like his, this mighty reasoner
was not content to give up his opinions, which, though
they were not true, as he was himself unable to see, were at
any rate not confuted, in favour of a custom which had truth
on its side, but had not yet been confirmed. And yet, had not
his predecessor Agrippinus, and some of his fellow-bishops
throughout Africa, first tempted him to desert this custom,
even by the decision of a Council, he certainly would not have
dared to argue against it. But, amid the perplexities of so
obscure a question, and seeing everywhere around him a strong
universal custom, he would rather have put restraint upon
himself by prayer and stretching forth his mind towards God,
so as to have perceived or taught that for truth which was
afterwards decided by a general Council. But when he had
found relief amid his weariness in the authority of the former
Council<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> which was held by Agrippinus, he preferred maintaining
what was in a manner the discovery of his predecessors,
to expending further toil in investigation. For, at the
end of his letter to Quintus, he thus shows how he has sought
repose, if one may use the expression, for his weariness, in
what might be termed the resting-place of authority.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ix.</span>&mdash;14. "This moreover," says he, "Agrippinus, a
man of excellent memory, with the rest, bishops with him,
who at that time governed the Church of the Lord in the
province of Africa and Numidia, did, when by common counsel
duly weighed, establish and confirm; whose sentence, being
both religious and legitimate and salutary in accordance with
the Catholic faith and Church, we also have followed."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> By
this witness he gives sufficient proof how much more ready
he would have been to bear his testimony, had any Council
been held to discuss this matter which either embraced the
whole Church, or at least represented our brethren beyond
the sea. But such a Council had not yet been held, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the whole world was bound together by the powerful bond of
custom; and this was deemed sufficient to oppose to those who
wished to introduce what was new, because they could not
comprehend the truth. Afterwards, however, while the question
became matter for discussion and investigation amongst
many on either side, the new practice was not only invented,
but even submitted to the authority and power of a general
Council,&mdash;after the martyrdom of Cyprian, it is true, but before
we were born.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> But that this was indeed the custom of the
Church, which afterwards was confirmed by a general Council,
in which the truth was brought to light, and many difficulties
cleared away, is plain enough from the words of the blessed
Cyprian himself in that same letter to Jubaianus, which was
quoted as being read in the Council.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> For he says, "But
some one asks, What then will be done in the case of those
who, coming out of heresy to the Church, have already been
admitted without baptism?" where certainly he shows plainly
enough what was usually done, though he would have wished
it otherwise; and in the very fact of his quoting the Council
of Agrippinus, he clearly proves that the custom of the Church
was different. Nor indeed was it requisite that he should seek
to establish the practice by this Council, if it was already
sanctioned by custom; and in the Council itself some of the
speakers expressly declare, in giving their opinion, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
went against the custom of the Church in deciding what they
thought was right. Wherefore let the Donatists consider this
one point, which surely none can fail to see, that if the authority
of Cyprian is to be followed, it is to be followed rather in
maintaining unity than in altering the custom of the Church;
but if respect is paid to his Council, it must at any rate yield
place to the later Council of the universal Church, of which he
rejoiced to be a member, often warning his associates that they
should all follow his example in upholding the coherence of
the whole body. For both later Councils are preferred among
later generations to those of earlier date; and the whole is
always, with good reason, looked upon as superior to the
parts.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. x.</span>&mdash;15. But what attitude do they assume, when it
is shown that the holy Cyprian, though he did not himself
admit as members of the Church those who had been baptized
in heresy or schism, yet held communion with those who did
admit them, according to his express declaration, "Judging
no one, nor depriving any one of the right of communion if
he differ from us?"<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> If he was polluted by communion with
persons of this kind, why do they follow his authority in the
question of baptism? But if he was not polluted by communion
with them, why do they not follow his example in maintaining
unity? Have they anything to urge in their defence except
the plea, "We choose to have it so?" What other answer
have any sinful or wicked men to the discourse of truth or
justice,&mdash;the voluptuous, for instance, the drunkards, adulterers,
and those who are impure in any way, thieves, robbers, murderers,
plunderers, evil-doers, idolaters,&mdash;what other answer
can they make when convicted by the voice of truth, except "I
choose to do it;" "It is my pleasure so?" And if they have
in them a tinge of Christianity, they say further, "Who art
thou that judgest another man's servant?"<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Yet these have so
much more remains of modesty, that when, in accordance with
divine and human law, they meet with punishment for their
abandoned life and deeds, they do not style themselves martyrs;
while the Donatists wish at once to lead a sacrilegious life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
enjoy a blameless reputation, to suffer no punishment for their
wicked deeds, and to gain a martyr's glory in their just punishment.
As if they were not experiencing the greater mercy and
patience of God, in proportion as "executing His judgments
upon them by little and little, He giveth them place of repentance,"<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
and ceases not to redouble His scourgings in this life;
that, considering what they suffer, and why they suffer it, they
may in time grow wise; and that those who have received the
baptism of the party of Maximianus in order to preserve the
unity of Donatus, may the more readily embrace the baptism
of the whole world in order to preserve the peace of Christ;
that they may be restored to the root, may be reconciled to
the unity of the Church, may see that they have nothing left
for them to say, though something yet remains for them to
do; that for their former deeds the sacrifice of loving-kindness
may be offered to a long-suffering God, whose unity they have
broken by their wicked sin, on whose sacraments they have
inflicted such a lasting wrong. For "the Lord is merciful
and gracious, slow to anger, plenteous in mercy and truth."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
Let them embrace His mercy and long-suffering in this life,
and fear His truth in the next. For He willeth not the death
of a sinner, but rather that he should turn from his way and
live;<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> because He bends His judgment against the wrongs
that have been inflicted on Him. This is our exhortation.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xi.</span>&mdash;16. For this reason, then, we hold them to be
enemies, because we speak the truth, because we are afraid to
be silent, because we fear to shrink from pressing our point
with all the force that lies within our power, because we obey
the apostle when he says, "Preach the word; be instant in
season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> But, as the
gospel says, "They love the praise of men more than the
praise of God;"<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and while they fear to incur blame for a
time, they do not fear to incur damnation for ever. They see,
too, themselves what wrong they are doing; they see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
they have no answer which they can make, but they overspread
the inexperienced with mists, whilst they themselves
are being swallowed up alive,&mdash;that is, are perishing knowingly
and wilfully. They see that men are amazed, and look
with abhorrence on the fact that they have divided themselves
into many schisms, especially in Carthage,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> the capital and
most noted city of all Africa; they have endeavoured to patch
up the disgrace of their rags. Thinking that they could annihilate
the followers of Maximianus, they pressed heavily on
them through the agency of Optatus the Gildonian;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> they inflicted
on them many wrongs amid the cruellest of persecutions.
Then they received back some, thinking that all could be converted
under the influence of the same terror; but they were
unwilling to do those whom they received the wrong of baptizing
afresh those who had been baptized by them in their schism,
or rather of causing them to be baptized again within their
communion by the very same men by whom they had been
baptized outside, and thus they at once made an exception to
their own impious custom. They feel how wickedly they are
acting in assailing the baptism of the whole world, when they
have received the baptism of the followers of Maximianus. But
they fear those whom they have themselves rebaptized, lest they
should receive no mercy from them, when they have shown it
to others; lest these should call them to account for their
souls when they have ceased to destroy those of other men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xii.</span>&mdash;17. What answer they can give about the
followers of Maximianus whom they have received, they cannot
divine. If they say, "Those we received were innocent,"
the answer is obvious, "Then you had condemned the inno<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>cent."
If they say, "We did it in ignorance," then you
judged rashly (just as you passed a rash judgment on the
<i>traditors</i>), and your declaration was false that "you must
know that they were condemned by the truthful voice of a
general Council."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> For indeed the innocent could never be
condemned by a voice of truth. If they say, "We did not condemn
them," it is only necessary to cite the Council, to cite the
names of bishops and states alike. If they say, "The Council
itself is none of ours," then we cite the records of the proconsular
province, where more than once they quoted the same
Council to justify the exclusion of the followers of Maximianus
from the basilicas, and to confound them by the din of
the judges and the force of their allies. If they say that
Felicianus of Musti, and Pr√¶textatus of Assav√¶, whom they
afterwards received, were not of the party of Maximianus,
then we cite the records in which they demanded, in the
courts of law, that these persons should be excluded from the
Council which they held against the party of Maximianus.
If they say, "They were received for the sake of peace," our
answer is, "Why then do ye not acknowledge the only true and
full peace? Who urged you, who compelled you to receive a
schismatic whom you had condemned, to preserve the peace of
Donatus, and to condemn the world unheard, in violation of
the peace of Christ?" Truth hems them in on every side.
They see that there is no answer left for them to make, and
they think that there is nothing left for them to do; they cannot
find out what to say. They are not allowed to be silent.
They had rather strive with perverse utterance against truth,
than be restored to peace by a confession of their faults.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xiii.</span>&mdash;18. But who can fail to understand what they
may be saying in their hearts? "What then are we to do,"
say they, "with those whom we have already rebaptized?"
Return with them to the Church. Bring those whom you have
wounded to be healed by the medicine of peace; bring those
whom you have slain to be brought to life again by the life
of charity. Brotherly union has great power in propitiating
God. "If two of you," says our Lord, "shall agree on earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for
them."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> If for two men who agree, how much more for two
communities? Let us throw ourselves together on our knees
before the Lord. Do you share with us our unity; let us share
with you your contrition; and let charity cover the multitude
of sins.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Seek counsel from the blessed Cyprian himself. See
how much he considered to depend upon the blessing of unity,
from which he did not sever himself to avoid the communion
of those who disagreed with him; how, though he considered
that those who were baptized outside the communion of the
Church had no true baptism, he was yet willing to believe
that, by simple admission into the Church, they might, merely
in virtue of the bond of unity, be admitted to a share in pardon.
For thus he solved the question which he proposed to himself
in writing as follows to Jubaianus: "But some will say, 'What
then will become of those who, in times past, coming to the
Church from heresy, were admitted without baptism?' The
Lord is able of His mercy to grant pardon, and not to sever
from the gifts of His Church those who, being out of simplicity
admitted to the Church, have in the Church fallen asleep."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xiv.</span>&mdash;19. But which is the worse, not to be baptized
at all, or to be twice baptized, it is difficult to decide. I see,
indeed, which is more repugnant and abhorrent to men's feelings;
but when I have recourse to that divine balance, in which the
weight of things is determined, not by man's feelings, but by
the authority of God, I find a statement by our Lord on either
side. For He said to Peter, "He who is washed has no need
of washing a second time;"<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and to Nicodemus, "Except a
man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into
the kingdom of God."<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> What is the purport of the more
secret determination of God, it is perhaps difficult for men like
us to learn; but as far as the mere words are concerned,
any one may see what a difference there is between "has no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
need of washing," and "cannot enter into the kingdom of
heaven." The Church, lastly, herself holds as her tradition,
that without baptism she cannot admit a man to her altar at
all; but since it is allowed that one who has been rebaptized
may be admitted after penance, surely this plainly proves that
his baptism is considered valid. If, therefore, Cyprian thought
that those whom he considered to be unbaptized yet had some
share in pardon, in virtue of the bond of unity, the Lord has
power to be reconciled even to the rebaptized by means of
the simple bond of unity and peace, and by this same compensating
power of peace to mitigate His displeasure against
those by whom they were rebaptized, and to pardon all the
errors which they had committed while in error, on their
offering the sacrifice of charity, which covereth the multitude
of sins; so that He looks not to the number of those who have
been wounded by their separation, but to the greater number
who have been delivered from bondage by their return. For
in the same bond of peace in which Cyprian conceived that,
through the mercy of God, those whom he considered to have
been admitted to the Church without baptism, were yet not
severed from the gifts of the Church, we also believe that
through the same mercy of God the rebaptized can earn their
pardon at His hands.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xv.</span>&mdash;20. Since the Catholic Church, both in the
time of the blessed Cyprian and in the older time before
him, contained within her bosom either some that were rebaptized
or some that were unbaptized, either the one section or
the other must have won their salvation only by the force
of simple unity. For if those who came over from the heretics
were not baptized, as Cyprian asserts, they were not rightly
admitted into the Church; and yet he himself did not despair
of their obtaining pardon from the mercy of God in virtue of
the unity of the Church. So again, if they were already baptized,
it was not right to rebaptize them. What, therefore, was
there to aid the other section, save the same charity that delighted
in unity, so that what was hidden from man's weakness,
in the consideration of the sacrament, might not be
reckoned, by the mercy of God, as a fault in those who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
lovers of peace? Why, then, while ye fear those whom ye
have rebaptized, do ye grudge yourselves and them the entrance
to salvation? There was at one time a doubt upon the subject
of baptism; those who held different opinions yet remained
in unity. In course of time, owing to the certain
discovery of the truth, that doubt was taken away. The question
which, unsolved, did not frighten Cyprian into separation
from the Church, invites you, now that it is solved, to return
once more within the fold. Come to the Catholic Church in
its agreement, which Cyprian did not desert while yet disturbed
with doubt; or if now you are dissatisfied with the
example of Cyprian, who held communion with those who
were received with the baptism of heretics, declaring openly
that we should "neither judge any one, nor deprive any one
of the right of communion if he differ from us,"<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> whither
are ye going, ye wretched men? What are ye doing? You
are bound to fly even from yourselves, because you have
advanced beyond the position where he abode. But if neither
his own sins nor those of others could stand in his way, on
account of the abundance of his charity and his love of
brotherly kindness and the bond of peace, do you return to us,
where you will find much less hindrance in the way of either
us or you from the fictions which your party have invented.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><small>AUGUSTINE UNDERTAKES THE REFUTATION OF THE ARGUMENTS WHICH MIGHT
BE DERIVED FROM THE EPISTLE OF CYPRIAN TO JUBAIANUS, TO GIVE
COLOUR TO THE VIEW THAT THE BAPTISM OF CHRIST COULD NOT BE
CONFERRED BY HERETICS.</small></p></blockquote>


<p class="cap">CHAP. I.&mdash;1. I think that it may now be considered clear
to every one, that the authority of the blessed Cyprian
for the maintenance of the bond of peace, and the avoiding of
any violation of that most wholesome charity which preserves
unity in the Church, may be urged on our side rather than
on the side of the Donatists. For if they have chosen to act
upon his example in rebaptizing Catholics, because he thought
that heretics ought to be baptized on joining the Catholic
Church, shall not we rather follow his example, whereby he
laid down a manifest rule that one ought in no wise, by the
establishment of a separate communion, to secede from the
Catholic communion, that is, from the body of Christians
dispersed throughout the world, even on the admission of
evil and sacrilegious men, since he was unwilling even to
remove from the right of communion those whom he considered
to have received sacrilegious men without baptism
into the Catholic communion, saying, "Judging no one,
nor depriving any of the right of communion if he differ
from us?"<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ii.</span>&mdash;2. Nevertheless, I see what may still be
required of me, viz. that I should answer those plausible
arguments, by which, in even earlier times, Agrippinus, or
Cyprian himself, or those in Africa who agreed with them, or
any others in far distant lands beyond the sea, were moved,
not indeed by the authority of any general or even provincial
Council, but by a mere epistolary correspondence, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
think that they ought to adopt a custom which had no
sanction from the ancient custom of the Church, and which
was expressly forbidden by the most unanimous resolution
of the Catholic world, in order that an error which had
begun to creep into the minds of some men, through discussions
of this kind, might be cured by the more powerful truth
and universal healing power of unity coming on the side of
safety. And so they may see with what security I approach
this discourse. If I am unable to gain my point, and show
how those arguments may be refuted which they bring forward
from the Council and the epistles of Cyprian, to the
effect that Christ's baptism may not be given by the hands
of heretics, I shall still remain safely in the Church, in
whose communion Cyprian himself remained with those who
differed from him.</p>

<p>3. But if they say that the Catholic Church existed then,
because there were a few, or, if they prefer it, even a considerable
number, who denied the validity of any baptism
conferred in an heretical body, and baptized all who came
from thence, what then? Did the Church not exist at all
before Agrippinus, with whom that new kind of system
began, at variance with all previous custom? Or how, again,
after the time of Agrippinus, when, unless there had been a
return to the primitive custom, there would have been no
need for Cyprian to set on foot another Council? Was there
no Church then, because such a custom as this prevailed
everywhere, that the baptism of Christ should be considered
nothing but the baptism of Christ, even though it were
proved to have been conferred in a body of heretics or
schismatics? But if the Church existed even then, and
had not perished through a breach of its continuity, but was,
on the contrary, holding its ground, and receiving increase
in every nation, surely it is the safest plan to abide by this
same custom, which then embraced good and bad alike in
unity. But if there was then no Church in existence,
because sacrilegious heretics were received without baptism,
and this prevailed by universal custom, whence has Donatus
made his appearance? from what land did he spring? or
from what sea did he emerge? or from what sky did he fall?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
And so we, as I had begun to say, are safe in the communion
of that Church, throughout the whole extent of which the
custom now prevails, which prevailed in like manner through
its whole extent before the time of Agrippinus, and in the
interval between Agrippinus and Cyprian, and whose unity
neither Agrippinus nor Cyprian ever deserted, nor those who
agreed with them, although they entertained different views
from the rest of their brethren,&mdash;all of them remaining in
the same communion of unity with the very men from whom
they differed in opinion. But let the Donatists themselves
consider what their true position is, if they neither can say
whence they derived their origin, if the Church had already
been destroyed by the plague-spot of communion with heretics
and schismatics received into her bosom without baptism;
nor again agree with Cyprian himself, for he declared that
he remained in communion with those who received heretics
and schismatics, and so also with those who were received as
well: while they have separated themselves from the communion
of the whole world, on account of the charge of
having delivered up the sacred books, which they brought
against the men whom they maligned in Africa, but failed
to convict when brought to trial beyond the sea; although,
even had the crimes which they alleged been true, they were
much less heinous than the sins of heresy and schism; and
yet these could not defile Cyprian in the persons of those
who came from them without baptism, as he conceived, and
were admitted without baptism into the Catholic communion.
Nor, in the very point in which they say that they imitate
Cyprian, can they find any answer to make about acknowledging
the baptism of the followers of Maximianus, together
with those whom, though they belonged to the party that
they had first condemned in their own general Council, and
then gone on to prosecute even at the tribunal of the secular
power, they yet received back into their communion, in the
episcopate of the very same bishop under whom they had
been condemned. Wherefore, if the communion of wicked
men destroyed the Church in the time of Cyprian, they have
no source from which they can derive their own communion;
and if the Church was not destroyed, they have no excuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
for their separation from it. Moreover, they are neither
following the example of Cyprian, since they have burst the
bond of unity, nor abiding by their own Council, since they
have recognised the baptism of the followers of Maximianus.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. iii</span>&mdash;4. Let us therefore, seeing that we adhere to
the example of Cyprian, go on now to consider Cyprian's
Council. What says Cyprian? "Ye have heard," he says,
"most beloved colleagues, what Jubaianus our fellow-bishop
has written to me, consulting my moderate ability concerning
the unlawful and profane baptism of heretics, and what
answer I gave him,&mdash;giving a judgment which we have once
and again and often given, that heretics coming to the Church
ought to be baptized and sanctified with the baptism of the
Church. Another letter of Jubaianus has likewise been read
to you, in which, agreeably to his sincere and religious devotion,
in answer to our epistle, he not only expressed his
assent, but returned thanks also, acknowledging that he had
received instruction."<a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> In these words of the blessed Cyprian,
we find that he had been consulted by Jubaianus, and what
answer he had given to his questions, and how Jubaianus
acknowledged with gratitude that he had received instruction.
Ought we then to be thought unreasonably persistent, if we
desire to consider this same epistle by which Jubaianus was
convinced? For till such time as we are also convinced (if
there are any arguments of truth whereby this can be done),
Cyprian himself has established our security by the right of
Catholic communion.</p>

<p>5. For he goes on to say: "It remains that we severally
declare our opinion on this same subject, judging no one, nor
depriving any one of the right of communion if he differ from
us."<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> He allows me, therefore, without losing the right of
communion, not only to continue inquiring into the truth, but
even to hold opinions differing from his own. "For no one
of us," he says, "setteth himself up as a bishop of bishops, or
by tyrannical terror forceth his colleagues to a necessity of
obeying." What could be more kind? what more humble?
Surely there is here no authority restraining us from inquiry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
into what is truth. "Inasmuch as every bishop," he says,
"in the free use of his liberty and power, has the right of
forming his own judgment, and can no more be judged by
another than he can himself judge another,"&mdash;that is, I
suppose, in those questions which have not yet been brought
to perfect clearness of solution; for he knew what a deep
question about the sacrament was then occupying the whole
Church with every kind of disputation, and gave free liberty
of inquiry to every man, that the truth might be made known
by investigation. For he was surely not uttering what was
false, and trying to catch his simpler colleagues in their speech,
so that, when they should have betrayed that they held
opinions at variance with his, he might then propose, in violation
of his promise, that they should be excommunicated.
Far be it from a soul so holy to entertain such accursed
treachery; indeed, they who hold such a view about such a
man, thinking that it conduces to his praise, do but show
that it would be in accordance with their own nature. I for
my part will in no wise believe that Cyprian, a Catholic
bishop, a Catholic martyr, whose greatness only made him
proportionately humble in all things, so as to find favour before
the Lord,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> should ever, especially in the sacred Council of his
colleagues, have uttered with his mouth what was not echoed
in his heart, especially as he further adds, "But we must all
await the judgment of our Lord Jesus Christ, who alone has
the power both of setting us in the government of His Church,
and of judging of our acts therein."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> When, then, he called
to their remembrance so solemn a judgment, hoping to hear
the truth from his colleagues, would he first set them the
example of lying? May God avert such madness from every
Christian man, and how much more from Cyprian! We have
therefore the free liberty of inquiry granted to us by the
most moderate and most truthful speech of Cyprian.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. iv.</span>&mdash;6. Next his colleagues proceed to deliver their
several opinions. But first they listened to the letter written
to Jubaianus; for it was read, as was mentioned in the
preamble. Let it therefore be read among ourselves also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
that we too, with the help of God, may discover from it what
we ought to think. "What!" I think I hear some one
saying, "do you proceed to tell us what Cyprian wrote to
Jubaianus?" I have read the letter, I confess, and should
certainly have been a convert to his views, had I not been
induced to consider the matter more carefully by the vast
weight of authority, originating in those whom the Church,
distributed throughout the world amid so many nations, of
Latins, Greeks, barbarians, not to mention the Jewish race
itself, has been able to produce,&mdash;that same Church which
gave birth to Cyprian himself,&mdash;men whom I could in no wise
bring myself to think had been unwilling without reason to
hold this view,&mdash;not because it was impossible that in so difficult
a question the opinion of one or of a few might not
have been more near the truth than that of more, but because
one must not lightly, without full consideration and investigation
of the matter to the best of his abilities, decide in favour
of a single individual, or even of a few, against the decision
of so very many men of the same religion and communion,
all endowed with great talent and abundant learning. And
so how much was suggested to me on more diligent inquiry,
even by the letter of Cyprian himself, in favour of the view
which is now held by the Catholic Church, that the baptism
of Christ is to be recognised and approved, not by the standard
of their merits by whom it is administered, but by His alone
of whom it is said, "The same is He which baptizeth,"<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> will
be shown naturally in the course of our argument. Let us
therefore suppose that the letter which was written by
Cyprian to Jubaianus has been read among us, as it was read
in the Council.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> And I would have every one read it who
means to read what I am going to say, lest he might possibly
think that I have suppressed some things of consequence.
For it would take too much time, and be irrelevant to the
elucidation of the matter in hand, were we at this moment
to quote all the words of this epistle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. v.</span>&mdash;7. But if any one should ask what I hold in
the meantime, while discussing this question, I answer that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
in the first place, the letter of Cyprian suggested to me what
I should hold till I should see clearly the nature of the
question which next begins to be discussed. For Cyprian
himself says: "But some will say, 'What then will become
of those who in times past, coming to the Church from
heresy, were admitted without baptism?'"<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Whether they
were really without baptism, or whether they were admitted
because those who admitted them conceived that they had
partaken of baptism, is a matter for our future consideration.
At any rate, Cyprian himself shows plainly enough what was
the ordinary custom of the Church, when he says that in
past time those who came to the Church from heresy were
admitted without baptism.</p>

<p>8. For in the Council itself Castus of Sicca says: "He
who, despising truth, presumes to follow custom, is either
envious or evil-disposed towards the brethren to whom the
truth is revealed, or is ungrateful towards God, by whose
inspiration His Church is instructed."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Whether the truth
had been revealed, we shall investigate hereafter; at any
rate, he acknowledges that the custom of the Church was
different.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. vi.</span>&mdash;9. Libosus also of Vaga says: "The Lord says
in the gospel, 'I am the Truth.'<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> He does not say, 'I am
custom.' Therefore, when the truth is made manifest, custom
must give way to truth."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Clearly no one could doubt that
custom must give way to truth where it is made manifest.
But we shall see presently about the manifestation of the
truth. Meanwhile he also makes it clear that custom was on
the other side.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. vii.</span>&mdash;10. Zosimus also of Tharassa said: "When a
revelation of the truth has been made, error must give way
to truth; for even Peter, who at the first circumcised, afterwards
gave way to Paul when he declared the truth."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> He
indeed chose to say error, not custom; but in saying "for even
Peter, who at the first circumcised, afterwards gave way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Paul when he declared the truth," he shows plainly enough
that there was a custom also on the subject of baptism at
variance with his views. At the same time, also, he warns
us that it was not impossible that Cyprian might have held
an opinion about baptism at variance with that required by
the truth, as held by the Church both before and after him,
if even Peter could hold a view at variance with the truth
as taught us by the Apostle Paul.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. viii.</span>&mdash;11. Likewise Felix of Buslacene said: "In
admitting heretics without the baptism of the Church, let no
one prefer custom to reason and truth; because reason and
truth always prevail to the exclusion of custom."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Nothing
could be better, if it be reason, and if it be truth; but this
we shall see presently. Meanwhile, it is clear from the words
of this man also that the custom was the other way.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ix.</span>&mdash;12. Likewise Honoratus of Tucca said: "Since
Christ is the Truth, we ought to follow truth rather than
custom."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> By all these declarations it is proved that we are
not excluded from the communion of the Church, till it shall
have been clearly shown what is the nature of the truth,
which they say must be preferred to our custom. But if the
truth has made it clear that the very regulation ought to be
maintained which the said custom had prescribed, then it is
evident, both that this custom was not established or confirmed
in vain, and also that, in consequence of the discussions
in question, the most wholesome observance of so great a
sacrament, which could never, indeed, have been changed in the
Catholic Church, was even more watchfully guarded with the
most scrupulous caution, when it had received the further corroboration
of Councils.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. x.</span>&mdash;13. Therefore Cyprian writes to Jubaianus as
follows, "concerning the baptism of heretics, who, being
placed without, and set down out of the Church," seem to
him to "claim to themselves a matter over which they have
neither right nor power. Which we," he says, "cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
account valid or lawful, since it is clear that among them it
is unlawful."<a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Neither, indeed, do we deny that a man who
is baptized among heretics, or in any schism outside the
Church, derives no profit from it so far as he is partner in
the perverseness of the heretics and schismatics; nor do we
hold that those who baptize, although they confer the real
true sacrament of baptism, are yet acting rightly, in gathering
adherents outside the Church, and entertaining opinions
contrary to the Church. But it is one thing to be without a
sacrament, another thing to be in possession of it wrongly,
and to usurp it unlawfully. Therefore they do not cease to
be sacraments of Christ and the Church, merely because they
are unlawfully used, not only by heretics, but by all kinds of
wicked and impious persons. These, indeed, ought to be corrected
and punished, but the sacraments should be acknowledged
and revered.</p>

<p>14. Cyprian, indeed, says that on this subject not one, but
two or more Councils were held; always, however, in Africa.
For indeed in one he mentions that seventy-one bishops had
been assembled,<a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>&mdash;to all whose authority we do not hesitate,
with all due deference to Cyprian, to prefer the authority, supported
by many more bishops, of the whole Church spread
throughout the whole world, of which Cyprian himself rejoiced
that he was an inseparable member.</p>

<p>15. Nor is the water "profane and adulterous"<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> over which
the name of God is invoked, even though it be invoked by
profane and adulterous persons; because neither the creature
itself of water, nor the name invoked, is adulterous. But the
baptism of Christ, consecrated by the words of the gospel, is
necessarily holy, however polluted and unclean its ministers
may be; because its inherent sanctity cannot be polluted, and
the divine excellence abides in its sacrament, whether to the
salvation of those who use it aright, or to the destruction of
those who use it wrong. Would you indeed maintain that,
while the light of the sun or of a candle, diffused through
unclean places, contracts no foulness in itself therefrom, yet
the baptism of Christ can be defiled by the sins of any man,
whatsoever he may be? For if we turn our thoughts to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
visible materials themselves, which are to us the medium of
the sacraments, every one must know that they admit of corruption.
But if we think on that which they convey to us,
who can fail to see that it is incorruptible, however much the
men through whose ministry it is conveyed are either being
rewarded or punished for the character of their lives?</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xi.</span>&mdash;16. But Cyprian was right in not being moved
by what Jubaianus wrote, that "the followers of Novatian
rebaptize those who come to them from the Catholic Church."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
For, in the first place, it does not follow that whatever heretics
have done in a perverse spirit of mimicry, Catholics are therefore
to abstain from doing, because the heretics do the same.
And again, the reasons are different for which heretics and the
Catholic Church ought respectively to abstain from rebaptizing.
For it would not be right for heretics to do so, even
if it were fitting in the Catholic Church; because their argument
is, that among the Catholics is wanting that which they
themselves received whilst still within the pale, and took
away with them when they departed. Whereas the reason why
the Catholic Church should not administer again the baptism
which was given among heretics, is that it may not seem to
decide that a power which is Christ's alone belongs to its members,
or to pronounce that to be wanting in the heretics which
they have received within her pale, and certainly could not
lose by straying outside. For thus much Cyprian himself, with
all the rest, established, that if any should return from heresy
to the Church, they should be received back, not by baptism,
but by the discipline of penitence; whence it is clear that they
cannot be held to lose by their secession what is not restored
to them when they return. Nor ought it for a moment to
be said that, as their heresy is their own, as their error is their
own, as the sacrilege of disunion is their own, so also the
baptism is their own, which is really Christ's. Accordingly,
while the evils which are their own are corrected when they
return, so in that which is not theirs His presence should be
recognised, from whom it is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xii.</span>&mdash;17. But the blessed Cyprian shows that it was
no new or sudden thing that he decided, because the practice
had already begun under Agrippinus. "Many years," he
says, "and much time has passed away since, under Agrippinus
of honoured memory, a large assembly of bishops determined
this point." Accordingly, under Agrippinus, at any
rate, the thing was new. But I cannot understand what
Cyprian means by saying, "And thenceforward to the present
day, so many thousand heretics in our provinces, having been
converted to our Church, showed no hesitation or dislike, but
rather with full consent of reason and will, have embraced the
opportunity of the grace of the laver of life and the baptism
unto salvation,"<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> unless indeed he says, "thenceforward to the
present day," because from the time when they were baptized
in the Church, in accordance with the Council of Agrippinus,
no question of excommunication had arisen in the case of any
of the rebaptized. Yet if the custom of baptizing those who
came over from heretics remained in force from the time of
Agrippinus to that of Cyprian, why should new Councils have
been held by Cyprian on this point? Why does he say to
this same Jubaianus that he is not doing anything new or
sudden, but only what had been established by Agrippinus?
For why should Jubaianus be disturbed by the question of
novelty, so as to require to be satisfied by the authority of
Agrippinus, if this was the continuous practice of the Church
from Agrippinus till Cyprian? Why, lastly, did so many of
his colleagues urge that reason and truth must be preferred
to custom, instead of saying that those who wished to act
otherwise were acting contrary to truth and custom alike?</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xiii.</span>&mdash;18. But as regards the remission of sins,
whether it is granted through baptism at the hands of the
heretics, I have already expressed my opinion on this point
in a former book,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> but I will shortly recapitulate it here.
If remission of sins is there conferred by the sacredness of
baptism, the sins return again through obstinate perseverance
in heresy or schism; and therefore such men must needs
return to the peace of the Catholic Church, that they may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
cease to be heretics and schismatics, and deserve that those sins
which had returned on them should be cleansed away by love
working in the bond of unity. But if, although among
heretics and schismatics it be still the same baptism of Christ,
it yet cannot work remission of sins owing to this same foulness
of discord and wickedness of dissent, then the same
baptism begins to be of avail for the remission of sins when
they come to the peace of the Church,&mdash;[not]<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> that what has
been already truly remitted should not be retained; nor that
heretical baptism should be repudiated as belonging to a different
religion, or as being different from our own, so that a
second baptism should be administered; but that the very
same baptism, which was working death by reason of discord
outside the Church, may work salvation by reason of the
peace within. It was, in fact, the same savour of which the
apostle says, "We are a sweet savour of Christ in every
place;" and yet, says he, "both in them that are saved, and
in them that perish. To the one we are the savour of life
unto life; and to the other the savour of death unto death."<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
And although he used these words with reference to another
subject, I have applied them to this, that men may understand
that what is good may not only work life to those who
use it aright, but also death to those who use it wrong.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xiv.</span>&mdash;19. Nor is it material, when we are considering
the question of the genuineness and holiness of the sacrament,
"what the recipient of the sacrament believes, and with what,
faith he is imbued." It is of the very highest consequence as
regards the entrance into salvation, but is wholly immaterial as
regards the question of the sacrament. For it is quite possible
that a man may be possessed of the genuine sacrament and a
corrupted faith, as it is possible that he may hold the words
of the creed in their integrity, and yet entertain an erroneous
belief about the Trinity, or the resurrection, or any other point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
For it is no slight matter, even within the Catholic Church,
to hold faith entirely consistent with the truth about even
God Himself, to say nothing of any of His creatures. Is it
then to be maintained, that if any one who has been baptized
within the Catholic Church itself should afterwards, in the
course of reading, or by listening to instruction, or by quiet
argument, find out, through God's own revelation, that he had
before believed otherwise than he ought, it is requisite that he
should therefore be baptized afresh? But what carnal and
natural man is there who does not stray through the vain
conceits<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> of his own heart, and picture God's nature to himself
to be such as he has imagined out of his carnal sense, and
differ from the true conception of God as far as vanity from
truth? Most truly, indeed, speaks the apostle, filled with the
light of truth: "The natural man," says he, "receiveth not
the things of the Spirit of God."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> And yet herein he was
speaking of men whom he himself shows to have been baptized.
For he says to them, "Was Paul crucified for you?
or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?"<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> These men had
therefore the sacrament of baptism; and yet, inasmuch as
their wisdom was of the flesh, what could they believe about
God otherwise than according to the perception of their flesh,
according to which "the natural man receiveth not the things
of the Spirit of God?" To such he says: "I could not speak
unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto
babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat:
for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are
ye able. For ye are yet carnal."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> For such are carried about
with every wind of doctrine, of which kind he says, "That we
be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with
every wind of doctrine."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Is it then true that, if these men
shall have advanced even to the spiritual age of the inner man,
and in the integrity of understanding shall have learned how
far different from the requirements of the truth has been the
belief which they have been led by the fallacious character of
their conceits to entertain of God, they are therefore to be
baptized again? For, on this principle, it would be possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
for a Catholic catechumen to light upon the writings of some
heretic, and, not having the knowledge requisite for discerning
truth from error, he might entertain some belief contrary to
the Catholic faith, yet not condemned by the words of the
creed, just as, under colour of the same words, innumerable
heretical errors have sprung up. Supposing, then, that the
catechumen was under the impression that he was studying
the work of some great and learned Catholic, and was baptized
with that belief in the Catholic Church, and by subsequent
research should discover what he ought to believe, so
that, embracing the Catholic faith, he should reject his former
error, ought he, on confessing this, to be baptized again?
Or supposing that, before learning and confessing this for himself,
he should be found to entertain such an opinion, and
should be taught what he ought to reject and what he should
believe, and it were to become clear that he had held this
false belief when he was baptized, ought he therefore to be
baptized again? Why should we maintain the contrary?
Because the sanctity of the sacrament, consecrated in the
words of the gospel, remains upon him in its integrity, just
as he received it from the hands of the minister, although
he, being firmly rooted in the vanity of his carnal mind, entertained
a belief other than was right at the time when he was
baptized. Wherefore it is manifest that it is possible that,
with defective faith, the sacrament of baptism may yet remain
without defect in any man; and therefore all that is said
about the diversity of the several heretics is beside the question.
For in each person that is to be corrected which is
found to be amiss by the man who undertakes his correction.
That is to be made whole which is unsound; that is to be
given which is wanting, and, above all, the peace of Christian
charity, without which the rest is profitless. Yet, as the rest
is there, we must not administer it as though it were wanting,
only take care that its possession be to the profit, not the hurt
of him who has it, through the very bond of peace and excellence
of charity.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xv.</span>&mdash;20. Accordingly, if Marcion consecrated the
sacrament of baptism with the words of the gospel, "In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,"<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
the sacrament was complete, although his faith expressed under
the same words, seeing that he held opinions not taught by the
Catholic truth, was not complete, but stained with the falsity
of fables.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> For under these same words, "In the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost," not
Marcion only, or Valentinus, or Arius, or Eunomius, but the
carnal babes of the Church themselves (to whom the apostle
said, "I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as
unto carnal"), if they could be individually asked for an
accurate exposition of their opinions, would probably show a
diversity of opinions as numerous as the persons who held
them, "for the natural man receiveth not the things of the
Spirit of God." Can it, however, be said on this account that
they do not receive the complete sacrament? or that, if they
shall advance, and correct the vanity of their carnal opinions,
they must seek again what they had received? Each man
receives after the fashion of his own faith; yet how much does
he obtain under the guidance of that mercy of God, in the
confident assurance of which the same apostle says, "If in
anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this
to you?"<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Yet the snares of heretics and schismatics prove for
this reason only too pernicious to the carnally-minded, because
their very progress is intercepted when their vain opinions are
confirmed in opposition to the Catholic truth, and the perversity
of their dissension is strengthened against the Catholic
peace. Yet if the sacraments are the same, they are everywhere
complete, even when they are wrongly understood, and
perverted to be instruments of discord, just as the very
writings of the gospel, if they are only the same, are everywhere
complete, even though quoted with a boundless variety
of false opinions. For as to what Jeremiah says&mdash;"Why do
those who grieve me prevail against me? My wound is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
stubborn, whence shall I be healed? In its origin it became
unto me as lying water, having no certainty,"<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>&mdash;if the term
"water" were never used figuratively and in the allegorical
language of prophecy except to signify baptism, we should
have trouble in discovering what these words of Jeremiah
meant; but as it is, when "waters" are expressly used in the
Apocalypse<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> to signify "peoples," I do not see why, by "lying
water having no certainty," I should not understand, "a lying
people, whom I cannot trust."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xvi.</span>&mdash;21. But when it is said that "the Holy Spirit is
given only in the Catholic Church," I suppose that our ancestors
meant that we should understand thereby what the apostle
says, "Because the love of God is spread abroad in our hearts
by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> For this is that
very love which is wanting in all who are cut off from the
communion of the Catholic Church; and for lack of this,
"though they speak with the tongues of men and of angels,
though they understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and
though they have the gift of prophecy, and all faith, so that
they could remove mountains, and though they bestow all
their goods to feed the poor, and though they give their bodies
to be burned, it profiteth them nothing."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> But those are
wanting in God's love who do not care for the unity of the
Church; and consequently we are right in understanding that
the Holy Spirit may be said not to be received except in the
Catholic Church. For the Holy Spirit is not only given by the
laying on of hands amid the testimony of temporal sensible
miracles, as He was given in former days to be the credentials
of a rudimentary faith, and for the extension of the first beginnings
of the Church. For who expects in these days that
those on whom hands are laid that they may receive the Holy
Spirit should forthwith begin to speak with tongues? but it is
understood that invisibly and imperceptibly, on account of the
bond of peace, divine love is breathed into their hearts, so that
they may be able to say, "Because the love of God is spread
abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
us." But there are many operations of the Holy Spirit, which
the same apostle commemorates in a certain passage at such
length as he thinks sufficient, and then concludes: "But all
these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to
every man severally as He will."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Since, then, the sacrament
is one thing, which even Simon Magus could have;<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> and the
operation of the Spirit is another thing, which is even often
found in wicked men, as Saul had the gift of prophecy;<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> and
that operation of the same Spirit is a third thing, which only
the good can have, as "the end of the commandment is charity
out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith
unfeigned:"<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> whatever, therefore, may be received by heretics
and schismatics, the charity which covereth the multitude of
sins is the especial gift of Catholic unity and peace; nor is it
found in all that are within that bond, since not all that are
within it are of it, as we shall see in the proper place. At
any rate, outside the bond that love cannot exist, without which
all the other requisites, even if they can be recognised and
approved, cannot profit or release from sin. But the laying on
of hands in reconciliation to the Church is not, like baptism,
incapable of repetition; for what is it more than a prayer
offered over a man?<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xvii.</span>&mdash;22. "For as regards the fact that to preserve
the figure of unity the Lord gave the power to Peter that whatsoever
he should loose on earth should be loosed,"<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> it is clear that
that unity is also described as one dove without fault.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Can
it be said, then, that to this same dove belong all those greedy
ones, whose existence in the same Catholic Church Cyprian
himself so grievously bewailed? For birds of prey, I believe,
cannot be called doves, but rather hawks. How then did they
baptize those who used to plunder estates by treacherous
deceit, and increase their profits by compound usury,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> if baptism
is only given by that indivisible and chaste and perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
dove, that unity which can only be understood as existing
among the good? Is it possible that, by the prayers of
the saints who are spiritual within the Church, as though by
the frequent lamentations of the dove, a great sacrament is
dispensed, with a secret administration of the mercy of God,
so that their sins also are loosed who are baptized, not by the
dove but by the hawk, if they come to that sacrament in the
peace of Catholic unity? But if this be so, why should it
not also be the case that, as each man comes from heresy or
schism to the Catholic peace, his sins should be loosed through
their prayers? But the integrity of the sacrament is everywhere
recognised, though it will not avail for the irrevocable
remission of sins outside the unity of the Church. Nor will
the prayers of the saints, or, in other words, the groanings
of that one dove, be able to help one who is set in heresy or
schism; just as they are not able to help one who is placed
within the Church, if by a wicked life he himself retain the
debts of his sins against himself, and that though he be baptized,
not by this hawk, but by the pious ministry of the dove
herself.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xviii.</span>&mdash;23. "As my Father hath sent me," says our
Lord, "even so send I you. And when He had said this, He
breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy
Ghost. Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto
them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained."<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
Therefore, if they represented the Church, and this was said
to them as to the Church herself, it follows that the peace of
the Church looses sins, and estrangement from the Church
retains them, not according to the will of men, but according
to the will of God and the prayers of the saints who are
spiritual, who "judge all things, but themselves are judged of
no man."<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> For the rock retains, the rock remits; the dove
retains, the dove remits; unity retains, unity remits. But the
peace of this unity exists only in the good, in those who are
either already spiritual, or are advancing by the obedience of
concord to spiritual things; it exists not in the bad, whether
they make disturbances abroad, or are endured within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Church with lamentations, baptizing and being baptized. But
just as those who are tolerated with groanings within the
Church, although they do not belong to the same unity of the
dove, and to that "glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle,
or any such thing,"<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> yet if they are corrected, and confess
that they approached to baptism most unworthily, are not
baptized again, but begin to belong to the dove, through whose
groans those sins are remitted which were retained in them
who were estranged from her peace; so those also who are
more openly without the Church, if they have received the
same sacraments, are not freed from their sins on coming, after
correction, to the unity of the Church, by a repetition of baptism,
but by the same law of charity and bond of unity. For
if "those only may baptize who are set over the Church, and
established by the law of the gospel and ordination as appointed
by the Lord," were they in any wise of this kind who seized
on estates by treacherous frauds, and increased their gains by
compound interest? I trow not, since those are established
by ordination as appointed of the Lord, of whom the apostle,
in giving them a standard, says, "Not greedy, not given to
filthy lucre."<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Yet men of this kind used to baptize in the time
of Cyprian himself; and he confesses with many lamentations
that they were his fellow-bishops, and endures them with the
great reward of tolerance. Yet did they not confer remission
of sins, which is granted through the prayers of the saints,
that is, the groans of the dove, whoever it be that baptizes,
if those to whom it is given belong to her peace. For the
Lord would not say to robbers and usurers, "Whose soever sins
ye remit, they shall be remitted to him; and whose soever
sins ye retain, they shall be retained." "Outside the Church,
indeed, nothing can be either bound or loosed, since there
there is no one who can either bind or loose;" but he is loosed
who has made peace with the dove, and he is bound who is
not at peace with the dove, whether he is openly without, or
appears to be within.</p>

<p>24. But we know that Dathan, Korah, and Abiram,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> who
tried to usurp to themselves the right of sacrificing, contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
to the unity of the people of God, and also the sons of Aaron
who offered strange fire upon the altar,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> did not escape punishment.
Nor do we say that such offences remain unpunished,
unless those guilty of them correct themselves, if the patience of
God leading them to repentance<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> give them time for correction.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xix.</span>&mdash;25. They indeed who say that baptism is not
to be repeated, because only hands were laid on those whom
Philip the deacon had baptized,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> are saying what is quite
beside the point; and far be it from us, in seeking the truth,
to use such arguments as this. Wherefore we are all the
further from "yielding to heretics,"<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> if we deny that what they
possess of Christ's Church is their own property, and do not
refuse to acknowledge the standard of our General because of
the crimes of deserters; nay, all the more because "the Lord
our God is a jealous God,"<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> let us refuse, whenever we see
anything of His with an alien, to allow him to consider it
his own. For of a truth the jealous God Himself rebukes
the woman who commits fornication against Him, as the type
of an erring people, and says that she gave to her lovers what
belonged to Him, and again received from them what was not
theirs but His. In the hands of the adulterous woman and
the adulterous lovers, God in His wrath, as a jealous God, recognises
His gifts; and do we say that baptism, consecrated
in the words of the gospel, belongs to heretics? and are we
willing, from consideration of their deeds, to attribute to them
even what belongs to God, as though they had the power to
pollute it, or as though they could make what is God's to be
their own, because they themselves have refused to belong
to God?</p>

<p>26. Who is that adulterous woman whom the prophet Hosea
points out, who said, "I will go after my lovers, that give
me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, and everything
that befits me?"<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Let us grant that we may understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
this also of the people of the Jews that went astray; yet
whom else are the false Christians (such as are all heretics
and schismatics) wont to imitate, except false Israelites? For
there were also true Israelites, as the Lord Himself bears
witness to Nathanael, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom
is no guile."<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> But who are true Christians, save those of
whom the same Lord said, "He that hath my commandments,
and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me?"<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> But
what is it to keep His commandments, except to abide in love?
Whence also He says, "A new commandment I give unto you,
that ye love one another;" and again, "By this shall all men
know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another."<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
But who can doubt that this was spoken not only to those who
heard His words with their fleshly ears when He was present
with them, but also to those who learn His words through the
gospel, when He is sitting on His throne in heaven? For
He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfil.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> But the fulfilling
of the law is love.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> And in this Cyprian abounded
greatly, insomuch that though he held a different view concerning
baptism, he yet did not forsake the unity of the
Church, and was in the Lord's vine a branch firmly rooted,
bearing fruit, which the heavenly Husbandman purged with
the knife of suffering, that it should bear more fruit.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> But
the enemies of this brotherly love, whether they are openly
without, or appear to be within, are false Christians, and antichrists.
For when they have found an opportunity, they go
out, as it is written: "A man wishing to separate himself
from his friends, seeketh opportunities."<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> But even if occasions
are wanting, while they seem to be within, they are
severed from that invisible bond of love. Whence St. John
says, "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for
had they been of us, they would no doubt have continued
with us."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> He does not say that they ceased to be of us by
going out, but that they went out because they were not of
us. The Apostle Paul also speaks of certain men who had
erred concerning the truth, and were overthrowing the faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of some; whose word was eating as a canker. Yet in saying
that they should be avoided, he nevertheless intimates that
they were all in one great house, but as vessels to dishonour,&mdash;I
suppose because they had not as yet gone out. Or if they
had already gone out, how can he say that they were in the
same great house with the honourable vessels, unless it was
in virtue of the sacraments themselves, which even in the
severed meetings of heretics are not changed, that he speaks
of all as belonging to the same great house, though in different
degrees of esteem, some to honour and some to dishonour?
For thus he speaks in his Epistle to Timothy: "But shun
profane and vain babblings; for they will increase unto more
ungodliness. And their word will eat as doth a canker; of
whom is Hymen√¶us and Philetus; who concerning the truth
have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and
overthrow the faith of some. Nevertheless the foundation of
God standeth firm, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them
that are His. And, Let every one that nameth the name of
Christ depart from iniquity. But in a great house there are
not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and
of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. If a
man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel
unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and
prepared unto every good work."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> But what is it to purge
oneself from such as these, except what he said just before,
"Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from
iniquity?" And lest any one should think that, as being in one
great house with them, he might perish with such as these,
he has most carefully forewarned them, "The Lord knoweth
them that are His,"&mdash;those, namely, who, by departing from
iniquity, purge themselves from the vessels made to dishonour,
lest they should perish with them whom they are compelled
to tolerate in the great house.</p>

<p>27. They, therefore, who are wicked, evil-doers, carnal,
fleshly, devilish, think that they receive at the hands of their
seducers what are the gifts of God alone, whether sacraments,
or any spiritual workings about present salvation. But these
men have not love towards God, but are busied about those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
by whose pride they are led astray, and are compared to the
adulterous woman, whom the prophet introduces as saying,
"I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my
water, my wool and my flax, and my oil, and everything
that befits me." For thus arise heresies and schisms, when
the fleshly people which is not founded on the love of God
says, "I will go after my lovers," with whom, either by corruption
of her faith, or by the puffing up of her pride, she
shamefully commits adultery. But for the sake of those who,
having undergone the difficulties, and straits, and barriers of
the empty reasoning of those by whom they are led astray,
afterwards feel the prickings of fear, and return to the way of
peace, to seeking God in all sincerity,&mdash;for their sake He goes
on to say, "Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with
thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.
And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake
them; and she shall seek them, but she shall not find them:
then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband;
for then was it better with me than now." Then, that they
may not attribute to their seducers what they have that is
sound, and derived from the doctrine of truth, by which they
lead them astray to the falseness of their own dogmas and dissensions;
that they may not think that what is sound in them
belongs to them, he immediately added, "And she did not
know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied
her money; but she made vessels of gold and silver for
Baal."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> For she had said above, "I will go after my lovers,
that give me my bread," etc., not at all understanding that
all this, which was held soundly and lawfully by her seducers,
was of God, and not of men. Nor would even they themselves
claim these things for themselves, and as it were assert
a right in them, had not they in turn been led astray by a
people which had gone astray, when faith is reposed in them,
and such honours are paid to them, that they should be enabled
thereby to say such things, and claim such things for themselves,
that their error should be called truth, and their iniquity
be thought righteousness, in virtue of the sacraments
and Scriptures, which they hold, not for salvation, but only in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
appearance. Accordingly, the same adulterous woman is addressed
by the mouth of Ezekiel: "Thou hast also taken thy
fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given
thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit
whoredom with them; and tookest my<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> broidered garments, and
coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense
before them. My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and
oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it
before them for a sweet savour: and this thou hast done."<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
For she turns all the sacraments, and the words of the sacred
books, to the images of her own idols, with which her carnal
mind delights to wallow. Nor yet, because those images are
false, and the doctrines of devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
are those sacraments and divine utterances therefore so to lose
their due honour, as to be thought to belong to such as these;
seeing that the Lord says, "Of my gold, and my silver, and
my broidered garments, and mine oil, and mine incense, and
my meat," and so forth. Ought we, because those erring
ones think that these things belong to their seducers, therefore
not to recognise whose they really are, when He Himself
says, "And she did not know that I gave her corn, and
wine, and oil, and multiplied her money?" For He did not
say that she did not have these things because she was an
adulteress; but she is said to have had them, and that not
as belonging to herself or her lovers, but to God, whose alone
they are. Although, therefore, she had her fornication, yet
those things wherewith she adorned it, whether as seduced or
in her turn seducing, belonged not to her, but to God. If
these things were spoken in a figure of the Jewish nation,
when the scribes and Pharisees were rejecting the commandment
of God in order to set up their own traditions, so that
they were in a manner committing whoredom with a people
which was abandoning their God; and yet for all that, whoredom
at that time among the people, such as the Lord brought
to light by convicting it, did not cause that the mysteries
should belong to them, which were not theirs but God's, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
in speaking to the adulteress, says that all these things were
His; whence the Lord Himself also sent those whom He
cleansed from leprosy to the same mysteries, that they should
offer sacrifice for themselves before the priests, because that
sacrifice had not become efficacious for them, which He Himself
afterwards wished to be commemorated in the Church for
all of them, because He Himself proclaimed the tidings to
them all;&mdash;if this be so, how much the more ought we, when
we find the sacraments of the New Testament among certain
heretics or schismatics, not to attribute them to these men,
nor to condemn them, as though we could not recognise them?
We ought to recognise the gifts of the true husband, though
in the possession of an adulteress, and to amend, by the word
of truth, that whoredom which is the true possession of the
unchaste woman, instead of finding fault with the gifts, which
belong entirely to the pitying Lord.</p>

<p>28. From these considerations, and such as these, our forefathers,
not only before the time of Cyprian and Agrippinus,
but even afterwards, maintained a most wholesome custom,
that whenever they found anything divine and lawful remaining
in its integrity even in the midst of any heresy or schism,
they approved rather than repudiated it; but whatever they
found that was alien, and peculiar to that false doctrine or
division, this they convicted in the light of the truth, and
healed. The points, however, which remain to be considered
in the letter written by Jubaianus, must, I think, when looking
at the size of this book, be taken in hand and treated
with a fresh beginning.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><small>IN WHICH HE TREATS OF WHAT FOLLOWS IN THE SAME EPISTLE OF CYPRIAN
TO JUBAIANUS.</small></p></blockquote>


<p class="cap">CHAP. I.&mdash;1. The comparison of the Church with Paradise<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
shows us that men may indeed receive her baptism
outside her pale, but that no one outside can either receive or
retain the salvation of eternal happiness. For, as the words
of Scripture testify, the streams from the fountain of Paradise
flowed copiously even beyond its bounds. Record indeed is
made of their names; and through what countries they flow,
and that they are situated beyond the limits of Paradise, is
known to all;<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> and yet in Mesopotamia, and in Egypt, to
which countries those rivers extended, there is not found that
blessedness of life which is recorded in Paradise. Accordingly,
though the waters of Paradise are found beyond its
boundaries, yet its happiness is in Paradise alone. So, therefore,
the baptism of the Church may exist outside, but the
gift of the life of happiness is found alone within the Church,
which has been founded on a rock, which has received the
keys of binding and loosing.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> "She it is alone who holds as
her privilege the whole power of her Bridegroom and Lord;"
by virtue of which power as bride, she can bring forth sons
even of handmaids. And these, if they be not high-minded,
shall be called into the lot of the inheritance; but if they be
high-minded, they shall remain outside.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ii.</span>&mdash;2. All the more, then, because we are fighting
for the honour and unity of the Church, let us beware of
giving to heretics the credit of whatever we acknowledge
among them as belonging to the Church; but let us teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
them by argument, that what they possess that is derived
from unity is of no efficacy to their salvation, unless they
shall return to that same unity. For "the water of the
Church is full of faith, and salvation, and holiness" to those
who use it rightly. No one, however, can use it well outside
the Church. But to those who use it perversely,
whether within or without the Church, it is employed to
work punishment, and does not conduce to their reward.
And so baptism "cannot be corrupted and polluted," though
it be handled by the corrupt or by adulterers, just as also "the
Church herself is uncorrupt, and pure, and chaste." And so no
share in it belongs to the avaricious, or thieves, or usurers,&mdash;many
of whom, by the testimony of Cyprian himself in many
places of his letters, exist not only without, but actually
within the Church,&mdash;and yet they both are baptized and do
baptize, with no change in their hearts.</p>

<p>3. For this, too, he says, in one of his epistles<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> to the clergy
on the subject of prayer to God, in which, after the fashion of
the holy Daniel, he represents the sins of his people as falling
upon himself. For among many other evils of which he
makes mention, he speaks of them also as "renouncing the
world in words only and not in deeds;" as the apostle says
of certain men, "They profess that they know God, but in
works they deny Him."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> These, therefore, the blessed
Cyprian shows to be contained within the Church herself,
who are baptized without their hearts being changed for the
better, seeing that they renounce the world in words and not
in deeds, as the Apostle Peter says, "The like figure whereunto
even baptism doth now save us, (not the putting away
of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience),"<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
which certainly they had not of whom it is said that they
"renounced the world in words only, and not in deeds;" and
yet he does his utmost, by chiding and convincing them, to
make them at length walk in the way of Christ, and be His
friends rather than friends of the world.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. iii.</span>&mdash;3. And if they would have obeyed him, and
begun to live rightly, not as false but as true Christians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
would he have ordered them to be baptized anew? Surely
not; but their true conversion would have gained this for
them, that the sacrament which availed for their destruction
while they were yet unchanged, should begin when they
changed to avail for their salvation.</p>

<p>4. For neither are they "devoted to the Church"<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> who
seem to be within, and live contrary to Christ, that is, act
against His commandments; nor can they be considered in
any way to belong to that Church, which He so purifies by
the washing of water, "that He may present to Himself a
glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such
thing."<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> But if they are not in that Church to whose
members they do not belong, they are not in the Church of
which it is said, "My dove is but one; she is the only one
of her mother;"<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> for she herself is without spot or wrinkle.
Or else let him who can assert that those are members of
this dove who renounce the world in words but not in deeds.
Meantime there is one thing which we see, from which I
think it was said, "He that regardeth the day, regardeth it
unto the Lord;"<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> for God judgeth every day. For, according
to His foreknowledge, who knows whom He has foreordained
before the foundation of the world to be made like
to the image of His Son, many who are even openly outside,
and are called heretics, are better than many good Catholics.
For we see what they are to-day, what they shall be to-morrow
we know not. And with God, with whom the future
is already present, they already are what they shall hereafter
be. But we, according to what each man is at present, inquire
whether they are to be to-day reckoned among the members
of the Church which is called the one dove, and the Bride of
Christ without spot or wrinkle,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> of whom Cyprian says in
the letter which I have quoted above, that "they did not
keep in the way of the Lord, nor observe the commandments
given unto them for their salvation; that they did not fulfil
the will of their Lord, being eager about their property and
gains, following the dictates of pride, giving way to envy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
dissension, careless about single-mindedness and faith, renouncing
the world in words only and not in deeds, pleasing each
himself, and displeasing all men."<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> But if the dove does not
acknowledge them among her members, and if the Lord shall
say to them, supposing that they continue in the same perversity,
"I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work
iniquity;"<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> then they seem indeed to be in the Church, but
are not; "nay, they even act against the Church. How
then can they baptize with the baptism of the Church,"<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
which is of avail neither to themselves, nor to those who
receive it from them, unless they are changed in heart with
a true conversion, so that the sacrament itself, which did not
avail them when they received it whilst they were renouncing
the world in words and not in deeds, may begin to profit
them when they shall begin to renounce it in deeds also?
And so too in the case of those whose separation from the
Church is open; for neither these nor those are as yet among
the members of the dove, but some of them perhaps will be
at some future time.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. iv.</span>&mdash;5. We do not, therefore, "acknowledge the
baptism of heretics,"<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> when we refuse to rebaptize after them;
but because we acknowledge the ordinance to be of Christ,
even among evil men, whether openly separated from us, or
secretly severed whilst within our body, we receive it with due
respect, having corrected those who were wrong in the points
wherein they went astray. For as I seem to be hard pressed
when it is said to me, "Does then a heretic confer remission
of sins?" so I in turn press hard when I say, Does then he
who violates the commands of Heaven, the avaricious man,
the robber, the usurer, the envious man, does he who renounces
the world in words and not in deeds, confer such
remission? If you mean by the force of God's sacrament,
then both the one and the other; if by his own merit,
neither of them. For that sacrament, even in the hands of
wicked men, is known to be of Christ; but neither the one
nor the other of these men is found in the body of the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
uncorrupt, holy, chaste dove, which has neither spot nor
wrinkle. And just as baptism is of no profit to the man who
renounces the world in words and not in deeds, so it is of
no profit to him who is baptized in heresy or schism; but
each of them, when he amends his ways, begins to receive
profit from that which before was not profitable, but was yet
already in him.</p>

<p>6. "He therefore that is baptized in heresy does not become
the temple of God;"<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> but does it therefore follow that
he is not to be considered as baptized? For neither does
the avaricious man, baptized within the Church, become the
temple of God, unless he depart from his avarice; for they
who become the temple of God certainly inherit the kingdom
of God. But the apostle says, among many other things,
"Neither the covetous, nor thieves, shall inherit the kingdom
of God."<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> For in another place the same apostle compares
covetousness to the worship of idols: "Nor covetous man," he
says, "who is an idolater;"<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> which meaning the same Cyprian
has so far extended in a letter to Antonianus, that he did not
hesitate to compare the sin of covetousness with that of men
who in time of persecution had declared in writing that they
would offer incense.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> The man, then, who is baptized in
heresy in the name of the Holy Trinity yet does not become
the temple of God unless he abandons his heresy, just as the
covetous man who has been baptized in the same name does
not become the temple of God unless he abandons his covetousness,
which is idolatry. For this, too, the same apostle
says: "What agreement hath the temple of God with idols?"<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
Let it not, then, be asked of us "of what God he is made the
temple?"<a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> when we say that he is not made the temple of
God at all. Yet he is not therefore unbaptized, nor does his
foul error cause that what he has received, consecrated in the
words of the gospel, should not be the holy sacrament; just
as the other man's covetousness (which is idolatry) and great
uncleanness cannot prevent what he receives from being holy
baptism, even though he be baptized with the same words of
the gospel by another man covetous like himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>&mdash;7. "Further," Cyprian goes on to say, "in vain
do some, who are overcome by reason, oppose to us custom,
as though custom were superior to truth, or that were not
to be followed in spiritual things which has been revealed by
the Holy Spirit, as the better way."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> This is clearly true,
since reason and truth are to be preferred to custom. But
when truth supports custom, nothing should be more strongly
maintained. Then he proceeds as follows: "For one may
pardon a man who merely errs, as the Apostle Paul says of
himself, 'Who was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and
injurious; but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly;'<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
but he who, after inspiration and revelation given, perseveres
advisedly and knowingly in his former error, sins without
hope of pardon on the ground of ignorance. For he rests on
a kind of presumption and obstinacy, when he is overcome by
reason." This is most true, that his sin is much more grievous
who has sinned wittingly than his who has sinned through
ignorance. And so in the case of the holy Cyprian, who was
not only learned, but also patient of instruction, which he so
fully himself understood to be a part of the praise of the
bishop whom the apostle describes,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> that he said, "This also
should be approved in a bishop, that he not only teach with
knowledge, but also learn with patience."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> I do not doubt
that if he had had the opportunity of discussing this question,
which has been so long and so much disputed in the Church,
with the pious and learned men to whom we owe it that subsequently
that ancient custom was confirmed by the authority
of a general Council, he would have shown, without hesitation,
not only how learned he was in those things which he
had grasped with all the security of truth, but also how ready
he was to receive instruction in what he had failed to perceive.
And yet, since it is so clear that it is much more
grievous to sin wittingly than in ignorance, I should be glad
if any one would tell me which is the worse,&mdash;the man who
falls into heresy, not knowing how great a sin it is, or the
man who refuses to abandon his covetousness, knowing its
enormity. I might even put the question thus: If one man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
unwittingly fall into heresy, and another knowingly refuse to
depart from idolatry, since the apostle himself says, "The
covetous man, which is an idolater;" and Cyprian too understood
the same passage in just the same way, when he says,
in his letter to Antonianus, "Nor let the new heretics flatter
themselves in this, that they say they do not communicate
with idolaters, whereas there are amongst them both adulterers
and covetous persons, who are held guilty of the sin of
idolatry; 'for know this, and understand, that no whoremonger,
nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an
idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and
of God;'<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and again, 'Mortify therefore your members which
are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection,
evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry.'"<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
I ask, therefore, which sins more deeply,&mdash;he who ignorantly
has fallen into heresy, or he who wittingly has refused to
abandon covetousness, that is idolatry? According to that
rule by which the sins of those who sin wittingly are placed
before those of the ignorant, the man who is covetous with
knowledge takes the first place in sin. But as it is possible
that the greatness of the actual sin should produce the same
effect in the case of heresy that the witting commission of
the sin produces in that of covetousness, let us suppose the
ignorant heretic to be on a par in guilt with the consciously
covetous man, although the evidence which Cyprian himself
has advanced from the apostle does not seem to prove this.
For what is it that we abominate in heretics except their
blasphemies? But when he wished to show that ignorance
of the sin may conduce to ease in obtaining pardon, he advanced
a proof from the case of the apostle, when he says,
"Who before was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious;
but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly."<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
But if possible, as I said before, let the sins of the two men&mdash;the
blasphemy of the unconscious, and the idolatry of the
conscious sinner&mdash;be esteemed of equal weight; and let them
be judged by the same sentence,&mdash;he who, in seeking for Christ,
falls into a truth-like setting forth of what is false, and he
who wittingly resists Christ speaking through His apostle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
"seeing that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous
man, which is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom
of Christ and of God,"<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>&mdash;and then I would ask why baptism
and the words of the gospel are held as naught in the
former case, and accounted valid in the latter, when each is
alike found to be estranged from the members of the dove.
Is it because the former is an open combatant outside, that
he should not be admitted, the latter a cunning assenter within
the fold, that he may not be expelled?</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. vi.</span>&mdash;8. But as regards his saying, "Nor let any one
affirm that what they have received from the apostles, that
they follow; for the apostles handed down only one Church
and one baptism, and that appointed only in the same
Church;"<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> this does not so much move me to venture to
condemn the baptism of Christ when found amongst heretics
(just as it is necessary to recognise the gospel itself when I
find it with them, though I abominate their error), as it warns
me that there were some even in the times of the holy
Cyprian who traced to the authority of the apostles that
custom against which the African Councils were held, and in
respect of which he himself said a little above, "In vain do
those who are beaten by reason oppose to us the authority of
custom." Nor do I find the reason why the same Cyprian
found this very custom, which after his time was confirmed
by nothing less than a general Council of the whole world,
already so strong before his time, that when with all his learning
he sought an authority worth following for changing it,
he found nothing but a Council of Agrippinus held in Africa
a very few years before his own time. And seeing that this
was not enough for him, as against the custom of the whole
world, he laid hold on these reasons which we just now, considering
them with great care, and being confirmed by the antiquity
of the custom itself, and by the subsequent authority
of a general Council, found to be truth-like rather than true;
which, however, seemed to him true, as he toiled in a question
of the greatest obscurity, and was in doubt about the
remission of sins,&mdash;whether it could fail to be given in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
baptism of Christ, and whether it could be given among
heretics. In which matter, if an imperfect revelation of the
truth was given to Cyprian, that the greatness of his love in
not deserting the unity of the Church might be made manifest,
there is yet not any reason why any one should venture
to claim superiority over the strong defences and excellence of
his virtues, and the abundance of graces which were found in
him, merely because, with the instruction derived from the
strength of a general Council, he sees something which Cyprian
did not see, because the Church had not yet held a general
Council on the matter. Just as no one is so insane as to set
himself up as surpassing the merits of the Apostle Peter,
because, taught by the epistles of the Apostle Paul, and confirmed
by the custom of the Church herself, he does not compel
the Gentiles to Judaize, as Peter once had done.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>9. We do not then "find that any one, after being baptized
among heretics, was afterwards admitted by the apostles with
the same baptism, and communicated;"<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> but neither do we
find this, that any one coming from the society of heretics,
who had been baptized among them, was baptized anew by
the apostles. But this custom, which even then those who
looked back to past ages could not find to have been invented
by men of a later time, is rightly believed to have been
handed down from the apostles. And there are many other
things of the same kind, which it would be tedious to
recount. Wherefore, if they had something to say for themselves
to whom Cyprian, wishing to persuade them of the
truth of his own view, says, "Let no one say, What we have
received from the apostles, that we follow," with how much
more force we now say, What the custom of the Church has
always held, what this argument has failed to prove false,
and what a general Council has confirmed, this we follow!
To this we may add that it may also be said, after a careful
inquiry into the reasoning on both sides of the discussion,
and into the evidence of Scripture, What truth has declared,
that we follow.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. vii.</span>&mdash;10. For in fact, as to what some opposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the reasoning of Cyprian, that the apostle says, "Notwithstanding
every way, whether in pretence or in truth, let
Christ be preached,"<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Cyprian rightly exposed their error,
showing that it has nothing to do with the case of heretics,
since the apostle was speaking of those who were acting
within the Church, with malicious envy seeking their own
profit. They announced Christ, indeed, according to the truth
whereby we believe in Christ, but not in the spirit in which
He was announced by the good evangelists to the sons of the
dove. "For Paul," he says, "in his epistle was not speaking
of heretics, or of their baptism, so that it could be shown
that he had laid down anything concerning this matter. He
was speaking of brethren, whether as walking disorderly and
contrary to the discipline of the Church, or as keeping the
discipline of the Church in the fear of God. And he declared
that some of them spoke the word of God stedfastly and
fearlessly, but that some were acting in envy and strife; that
some had kept themselves encompassed with kindly Christian
love, but that others entertained malice and strife: but yet
that he patiently endured all things, with the view that,
whether in truth or in pretence, the name of Christ, which
Paul preached, might come to the knowledge of the greatest
number, and that the sowing of the word, which was as yet
a new and unaccustomed work, might spread more widely by
the preaching of those that spoke. Furthermore, it is one
thing for those who are within the Church to speak in
the name of Christ, another thing for those who are without,
acting against the Church, to baptize in the name of Christ."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
These words of Cyprian seem to warn us that we must distinguish
between those who are bad outside, and those who
are bad within the Church. And those whom he says that
the apostle represents as preaching the gospel impurely and
of envy, he says truly were within. This much, however,
I think I may say without rashness, if no one outside can have
anything which is of Christ, neither can any one within have
anything which is of the devil. For if that closed garden
can contain the thorns of the devil, why cannot the fountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
of Christ equally flow beyond the garden's bounds? But if
it cannot contain them, whence, even in the time of the
Apostle Paul himself, did there arise amongst those who were
within so great an evil of envy and malicious strife? For
these are the words of Cyprian. Can it be that envy and
malicious strife are a small evil? How then were those in
unity who were not at peace? For it is not my voice, nor
that of any man, but of the Lord Himself; nor did the sound
go forth from men, but from angels, at the birth of Christ,
"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of
good will."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> And this certainly would not have been proclaimed
by the voice of angels when Christ was born upon
the earth, unless God wished this to be understood, that those
are in the unity of the body of Christ who are united in the
peace of Christ, and those are in the peace of Christ who are
of good will. Furthermore, as good will is shown in kindliness,
so is bad will shown in malice.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Chap. viii.</span>&mdash;11. In short, we may see how great an evil
in itself is envy, which cannot be other than malicious. Let
us not look for other testimony. Cyprian himself is sufficient
for us, through whose mouth the Lord poured forth so
many thunders in most perfect truth, and uttered so many
useful precepts about envy and malignity. Let us therefore
read the letter of Cyprian about envy and malignity, and see
how great an evil it is to envy those better than ourselves,&mdash;an
evil whose origin he shows in memorable words to have
sprung from the devil himself. "To feel jealousy," he says,
"of what you regard as good, and to envy those who are
better than yourselves, to some, dearest brethren, seems a
light and minute offence."<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> And again a little later, when
he was inquiring into the source and origin of the evil, he
says, "From this the devil, in the very beginning of the
world, perished first himself, and led others to destruction."<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
And further on in the same chapter: "What an evil, dearest
brethren, is that by which an angel fell! by which that exalted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
and illustrious loftiness was able to be deceived and overthrown!
by which he was deceived who was the deceiver!
From that time envy stalks upon the earth, when man, about
to perish through malignity, submits himself to the teacher of
perdition,&mdash;when he who envies imitates the devil, as it is
written, 'Through envy of the devil came death into the
world, and they that do hold of his side do find it.'"<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> How
true, how forcible are these words of Cyprian, in an epistle
known throughout the world, we cannot fail to recognise. It
was truly fitting for Cyprian to argue and warn most forcibly
about envy and malignity, from which most deadly evil he
proved his own heart to be so far removed by the abundance
of his Christian love; by carefully guarding which he remained
in the unity of communion with his colleagues, who without
ill-feeling entertained different views about baptism, whilst
he himself differed in opinion from them, not through any
contention of ill will, but through human infirmity, erring in
a point which God, in His own good time, would reveal to
him by reason of his perseverance in love. For he says
openly, "Judging no one, nor depriving any of the right of
communion if he differ from us. For no one of us setteth
himself up as a bishop of bishops, or by tyrannical terror
forceth his colleagues to a necessity of obeying."<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> And in
the end of the epistle before us he says, "These things I have
written to you briefly, dearest brother, according to my poor
ability, prescribing to or prejudging no one, so as to prevent
each bishop from doing what he thinks right in the free exercise
of his own judgment. We, so far as in us lies, do not
strive on behalf of heretics with our colleagues and fellow-bishops,
with whom we hold the harmony that God enjoins,
and the peace of our Lord, especially as the apostle says,
'If any man seem to be contentious, we have no such
custom, neither the churches of God.'<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Christian love in
our souls, the honour of our colleges, the bond of faith, the
harmony of the priesthood, all these are maintained by us
with patience and gentleness. For this cause we have also,
so far as our poor ability admitted, by the permission and

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ix.</span>&mdash;12. By this patience of Christian love he not only
endured the difference of opinion manifested in all kindliness
by his good colleagues on an obscure point, as he also himself
received toleration, till, in process of time, when it so pleased
God, what had always been a most wholesome custom was
further confirmed by a declaration of the truth in a general
Council, but he even put up with those who were manifestly
bad, as was very well known to himself, who did not entertain
a different view in consequence of the obscurity of the question,
but acted contrary to their preaching in the evil practices
of an abandoned life, as the apostle says of them, "Thou that
preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?"<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> For
Cyprian says in his letter of such bishops of his own time,
his own colleagues, and remaining in communion with him,
"While they had brethren starving in the Church, they tried
to amass large sums of money, they took possession of estates
by fraudulent proceedings, they multiplied their gains by
accumulated usuries."<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> For here there is no obscure question.
Scripture declares openly, "Neither thieves nor covetous
shall inherit the kingdom of God;"<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> and "He that putteth out
his money to usury,"<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> and "No whoremonger, nor unclean
person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance
in the kingdom of Christ and of God."<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> He therefore
certainly would not, without knowledge, have brought accusations
of such covetousness, that men not only greedily treasured
up their own goods, but also fraudulently appropriated the
goods of others, or of idolatry existing in such enormity as he
understands and proves it to exist; nor assuredly would he
bear false witness against his fellow-bishops. And yet with
the bowels of fatherly and motherly love he endured them, lest
that, by rooting out the tares before their time, the wheat should
also have been rooted up,<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> imitating assuredly the Apostle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Paul, who, with the same love towards the Church, endured
those who were ill-disposed and envious towards him.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>13. But yet because "by the envy of the devil death
entered into the world, and they that do hold of his side do
find it,"<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> not because they are created by God, but because they
go astray of themselves, as Cyprian also says himself, seeing
that the devil, before he was a devil, was an angel, and good,
how can it be that they who are of the devil's side are in the
unity of Christ? Beyond all doubt, as the Lord Himself
says, "an enemy hath done this," who "sowed tares among
the wheat."<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> As therefore what is of the devil within the
fold must be convicted, so what is of Christ without must be
recognised. Has the devil what is his within the unity of the
Church, and shall Christ not have what is His without? This,
perhaps, might be said of individual men, that as the devil has
none that are his among the holy angels, so God has none that
are His outside the communion of the Church. But though
it may be allowed to the devil to mingle tares, that is, wicked
men, with this Church which still wears the mortal nature of
flesh, so long as it is wandering far from God, he being allowed
this just because of the pilgrimage of the Church herself, that
men may desire more ardently the rest of that country which
the angels enjoy, yet this cannot be said of the sacraments.
For, as the tares within the Church can have and handle them,
though not for salvation, but for the destruction to which they
are destined in the fire, so also can the tares without, which
received them from seceders from within; for they did not lose
them by seceding. This, indeed, is made plain from the fact
that baptism is not conferred again on their return, when any
of the very men who seceded happen to come back again.
And let not any one say, Why, what fruit hath the tares? For
if this be so, their condition is the same, so far as this goes, both
inside and without. For it surely cannot be that grains of
corn are found in the tares inside, and not in those without.
But when the question is of the sacrament, we do not consider
whether the tares bear any fruit, but whether they have any
share of heaven; for the tares, both within and without, share
the rain with the wheat itself, which rain is in itself heavenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
and sweet, even though under its influence the tares grow up
in barrenness. And so the sacrament, according to the gospel
of Christ, is divine and pleasant; nor is it to be esteemed as
naught because of the barrenness of those on whom its dew
falls even without.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. x.</span>&mdash;14. But some one may say that the tares within
may more easily be converted into wheat. I grant that it is
so; but what has this to do with the question of repeating
baptism? You surely do not maintain that if a man converted
from heresy, through the occasion and opportunity given by
his conversion, should bear fruit before another who, being
within the Church, is more slow to be washed from his iniquity,
and so corrected and changed, the former therefore needs
not to be baptized again, but the churchman to be baptized
again, who was outstripped by him who came from the heretics,
because of the greater slowness of his amendment. It has
nothing, therefore, to do with the question now at issue who
is later or slower in being converted from his especial waywardness
to the straight path of faith, or hope, or charity. For
although the bad within the fold are more easily made good,
yet it will sometimes happen that certain of the number of
those outside will outstrip in their conversion certain of those
within; and while these remain in barrenness, the former, being
restored to unity and communion, will bear fruit with patience,
thirty-fold, or sixty-fold, or a hundred-fold.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Or if those only
are to be called tares who remain in perverse error to the end,
there are many ears of corn outside, and many tares within.</p>

<p>15. But it will be urged that the bad outside are worse
than those within. It is indeed a weighty question, whether
Nicolaus, being already severed from the Church,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> or Simon,
who was still within it,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> was the worse,&mdash;the one being a
heretic, the other a sorcerer. But if the mere fact of division,
as being the clearest token of violated charity, is held to be
the worse evil, I grant that it is so. Yet many, though they
have lost all feelings of charity, yet do not secede from considerations
of worldly profit; and as they seek their own, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the things which are Jesus Christ's,<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> what they are unwilling
to secede from is not the unity of Christ, but their own temporal
advantage. Whence it is said in praise of charity, that
she "seeketh not her own."<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>16. Now, therefore, the question is, how could men of the
party of the devil belong to the Church, which has no spot,
or wrinkle, or any such thing,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> of which also it is said, "My
dove is one?"<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> But if they cannot, it is clear that she groans
among those who are not of her, some treacherously laying
wait within, some barking at her gate without. Such men,
however, even within, both receive baptism, and possess it, and
transmit it holy in itself; nor is it in any way defiled by their
wickedness, in which they persevere even to the end. Wherefore
the same blessed Cyprian teaches us that baptism is to be
considered as consecrated in itself by the words of the gospel,
as the Church has received, without joining to it or mingling
with it any consideration of waywardness and wickedness on
the part of either minister or recipients; since he himself
points out to us both truths,&mdash;both that there have been some
within the Church who did not cherish kindly Christian love,
but practised envy and unkind dissension, of whom the Apostle
Paul spoke; and also that the envious belong to the devil's
party, as he testifies in the most open way in the epistle which
he wrote about envy and malignity. Wherefore, since it is
clearly possible that in those who belong to the devil's party,
Christ's sacrament may yet be holy,&mdash;not, indeed, to their salvation,
but to their condemnation,&mdash;and that not only if they
are led astray after they have been baptized, but even if they
were such in heart when they received the sacrament, renouncing
the world (as the same Cyprian shows) in words
only and not in deeds;<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> and since even if afterwards they be
brought into the right way, the sacrament is not to be again
administered which they received when they were astray; so
far as I can see, the case is clear and evident, that in the
question of baptism we have to consider, not who gives, but
what he gives; not who receives, but what he receives; not
who has, but what he has. For if men of the party of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
devil, and therefore in no way belonging to the one dove, can
yet receive, and have, and give baptism in all its holiness, in
no way defiled by their waywardness, as we are taught by the
letters of Cyprian himself, how are we ascribing to heretics
what does not belong to them? how are we saying that what
is really Christ's is theirs, and not rather recognising in them
the signs of our Sovereign, and correcting the deeds of deserters
from Him? Wherefore it is one thing, as the holy Cyprian
says, "for those within, in the Church, to speak in the name
of Christ, another thing for those without, who are acting
against the Church, to baptize in His name."<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> But both
many who are within act against the Church by evil living,
and by enticing weak souls to copy their lives; and some who
are without speak in Christ's name, and are not forbidden to
work the works of Christ, but only to be without, since for
the healing of their souls we grasp at them, or reason with
them, or exhort them. For he, too, was without who did not
follow Christ with His disciples, and yet in Christ's name was
casting out devils, which the Lord enjoined that he should not
be prevented from doing;<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> although, certainly, in the point
where he was imperfect he was to be made whole, in accordance
with the words of the Lord, in which He says, "He that
is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with
me scattereth abroad."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Therefore both some things are done
outside in the name of Christ not against the Church, and
some things are done inside on the devil's part which are
against the Church.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xi.</span>&mdash;17. What shall we say of what is also wonderful,
that he who carefully observes may find that it is possible
that certain persons, without violating Christian charity, may
yet teach what is useless, as Peter wished to compel the Gentiles
to observe Jewish customs,<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> as Cyprian himself would
force heretics to be baptized anew? whence the apostle says
to such good members, who are rooted in charity, and yet
walk not rightly in some points, "If in anything ye be otherwise
minded, the Lord shall reveal even this unto you;"<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
that some again, though devoid of charity, may teach something
wholesome? of whom the Lord says, "The scribes and
Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: all therefore whatsoever they bid
you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their
works: for they say and do not."<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Whence the apostle also
says of those envious and malicious ones who yet preach salvation
through Christ, "Whether in pretence, or in truth, let
Christ be preached."<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Wherefore, both within and without,
the waywardness of man is to be corrected, but the divine
sacraments and utterances are not to be attributed to men.
He is not, therefore, a "patron of heretics" who refuses to
attribute to them what he knows not to belong to them, even
though it be found among them. We do not grant baptism
to be theirs; but we recognise His baptism of whom it is
said, "The same is He which baptizeth,"<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> wheresoever we
find it. But if "the treacherous and blasphemous man" continue
in his treachery and blasphemy, he receives no "remission
of sins either without" or within the Church; or if, by
the power of the sacrament, he receives it for the moment, the
same force operates both without and within, as the power of
the name of Christ used to work the expulsion of devils even
without the Church.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xii.</span>&mdash;18. But he urges that "we find that the
apostles, in all their epistles, execrated and abhorred the sacrilegious
wickedness of heretics, so as to say that 'their word
does spread as a canker.'"<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> What then? Does not Paul also
show that those who said, "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow
we die," were corrupters of good manners by their evil communications,
adding immediately afterwards, "Evil communications
corrupt good manners;" and yet he intimated that
these were within the Church when he says, "How say some
among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?"<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> But
when does he fail to express his abhorrence of the covetous?
Or could anything be said in stronger terms, than that
covetousness should be called idolatry, as the same apostle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
declared?<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Nor did Cyprian understand his language otherwise,
inserting it when need required in his letters; though
he confesses that in his time there were in the Church not
covetous men of an ordinary type, but robbers and usurers,
and these found not among the masses, but among the bishops.
And yet I should be willing to understand that those of whom
the apostle says, "Their word does spread as a canker," were
without the Church, but Cyprian himself will not allow me.
For, when showing, in his letter to Antonianus, that no man
ought to sever himself from the unity of the Church before
the time of the final separation of the just and unjust, merely
because of the admixture of evil men in the Church, when
he makes it manifest how holy he was, and deserving of the
illustrious martyrdom which he won, he says, "What swelling
of arrogance it is, what forgetfulness of humility and gentleness,
that any one should dare or believe that he can do what
the Lord did not grant even to the apostles,&mdash;to think that
he can distinguish the tares from the wheat, or, as if it were
granted to him to carry the fan and purge the floor, to endeavour
to separate the chaff from the grain! And whereas the
apostle says, 'But in a great house there are not only vessels
of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth,'<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> that
he should seem to choose those of gold and of silver, and to
despise and cast away and condemn those of wood and of
earth, when really the vessels of wood are only to be burned
in the day of the Lord by the burning of the divine conflagration,
and those of earth are to be broken by Him to
whom the 'rod of iron'<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> has been given."<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> By this argument,
therefore, against those who, under the pretext of
avoiding the society of wicked men, had severed themselves
from the unity of the Church, Cyprian shows that by the
great house of which the apostle spoke, in which there were
not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and
of earth, he understood nothing else but the Church, in which
there should be good and bad, till at the last day it should
be cleansed as a threshing-floor by the winnowing-fan. And
if this be so, in the Church herself, that is, in the great house
itself, there were vessels to dishonour, whose word did spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
like a canker. For the apostle, speaking of them, taught as
follows: "And their word," he says, "will eat as doth a
canker; of whom is Hymen√¶us and Philetus; who concerning
the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past
already; and overthrow the faith of some. Nevertheless the
foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord
knoweth them that are His. And, Let every one that nameth
the name of Christ depart from iniquity. But in a great
house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but
also of wood and of earth."<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> If, therefore, they whose word
did eat as doth a canker were as it were vessels to dishonour
in the great house, and by that "great house" Cyprian understands
the unity of the Church itself, surely it cannot be that
their canker polluted the baptism of Christ. Accordingly,
neither without, any more than within, can any one who is
of the devil's party, either in himself or in any other person,
stain the sacrament which is of Christ. It is not, therefore,
the case that "the word which eats as a canker to the ears
of those who hear it gives remission of sins;"<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> but when
baptism is given in the words of the gospel, however great be
the perverseness of understanding on the part either of him
through whom, or of him to whom it is given, the sacrament
itself is holy in itself on account of Him whose sacrament it
is. And if any one, receiving it at the hands of a misguided
man, yet does not receive the perversity of the minister, but
only the holiness of the mystery, being closely bound to the
unity of the Church in good faith and hope and charity, he
receives remission of his sins,&mdash;not by the words which do
eat as doth a canker, but by the sacraments of the gospel
flowing from a heavenly source. But if the recipient himself
be misguided, on the one hand, what is given is of no avail
for the salvation of the misguided man; and yet, on the other
hand, that which is received remains holy in the recipient,
and is not renewed to him if he be brought to the right way.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xiii.</span>&mdash;19. There is therefore "no fellowship between
righteousness and unrighteousness,"<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> not only without, but also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
within the Church; for "the Lord knoweth them that are
His," and "Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart
from iniquity." There is also "no communion between
light and darkness,"<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> not only without, but also within the
Church; for "he that hateth his brother is still in darkness."<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
And they at any rate hated Paul, who, preaching
Christ of envy and malicious strife, supposed that they added
affliction to his bonds;<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> and yet the same Cyprian understands
these still to have been within the Church. Since,
therefore, "neither darkness can enlighten, nor unrighteousness
justify,"<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> as Cyprian again says, I ask, how could those
men baptize within the very Church herself? I ask, how
could those vessels which the large house contains not to
honour, but to dishonour, administer what is holy for the
sanctifying of men within the great house itself, unless
because that holiness of the sacrament cannot be polluted
even by the unclean, either when it is given at their hands,
or when it is received by those who in heart and life are not
changed for the better? of whom, as situated within the
Church, Cyprian himself says, "Renouncing the world in word
only, and not in deed."<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>20. There are therefore also within the Church "enemies
of God, whose hearts the spirit of Antichrist has possessed;"
and yet they "deal with spiritual and divine things,"<a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> which
cannot profit for their salvation so long as they remain such
as they are; and yet neither can they pollute them by their
own uncleanness. With regard to what he says, therefore,
"that they have no part given them in the saving grace of
the Church, who, scattering and fighting against the Church
of Christ, are called adversaries by Christ Himself, and antichrists
by His apostles,"<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> this must be received under the
consideration that there are men of this kind both within and
without. But the separation of those that are within from
the perfection and unity of the dove is not only known in the
case of some men to God, but even in the case of some to
their fellow-men; for, by regarding their openly abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
life and confirmed wickedness, and comparing it with the
rules of God's commandments, they understand to what a
multitude of tares and chaff, situated now some within and
some without, but destined to be most manifestly separated at
the last day, the Lord will then say, "Depart from me, ye
that work iniquity,"<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> and "Depart into everlasting fire, prepared

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xiv.</span>&mdash;21. But we must not despair of the conversion
of any man, whether situated within or without, so long
as "the goodness of God leadeth him to repentance,"<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> and
"visits their transgressions with the rod, and their iniquity
with stripes." For in this way "He does not utterly take
from them His loving-kindness,"<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> if they will themselves
sometime "love their own soul, pleasing God."<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> But as the
good man "that shall endure to the end, the same shall be
saved,"<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> so the bad man, whether within or without, who
shall persevere in his wickedness to the end, shall not be
saved. Nor do we say that "all, wheresoever and howsoever
baptized, obtain the grace of baptism,"<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> if by the grace of
baptism is understood the actual salvation which is conferred
by the celebration of the sacrament; but many fail to obtain
this salvation even within the Church, although it is clear that
they possess the sacrament, which is holy in itself. Well,
therefore, does the Lord warn us in the gospel that we should
not company with ill-advisers,<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> who walk under the pretence
of Christ's name; but these are found both within and without,
as, in fact, they do not proceed without unless they have first
been ill-disposed within. And we know that the apostle said
of the vessels placed in the great house, "If a man therefore
purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour,
sanctified, and meet for the Master's use, and prepared unto
every good work."<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> But in what manner each man ought to
purge himself from these he shows a little above, saying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
"Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from
iniquity,"<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> that he may not in the last day, with the chaff,
whether with that which has already been driven from the
threshing-floor, or with that which is to be separated at the
last, hear the command, "Depart from me, ye that work
iniquity."<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> Whence it appears, indeed, as Cyprian says,
that "we are not at once to admit and adopt whatsoever is
professed in the name of Christ, but only what is done in the
truth of Christ."<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> But it is not an action done in the truth
of Christ that men should "seize on estates by fraudulent
pretences, and increase their gains by accumulated usury,"<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
or that they should "renounce the world in word only;"<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> and
yet, that all this is done within the Church, Cyprian himself
bears sufficient testimony.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xv.</span>&mdash;22. To go on to the point which he pursues
at great length, that "they who blaspheme the Father of
Christ cannot be baptized in Christ,"<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> since it is clear that
they blaspheme through error (for he who comes to the baptism
of Christ will not openly blaspheme the Father of Christ,
but he is led to blaspheme by holding a view contrary to the
teaching of the truth about the Father of Christ), we have
already shown at sufficient length that baptism, consecrated
in the words of the gospel, is not affected by the error of any
man, whether ministrant or recipient, whether he hold views
contrary to the revelation of divine teaching on the subject of
the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Ghost. For many carnal
and natural men are baptized even within the Church, as the
apostle expressly says: "The natural man receiveth not the
things of the Spirit of God;"<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> and after they had received
baptism, he says that they "are yet carnal."<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> But according
to its carnal sense, a soul given up to fleshly appetites cannot
entertain but fleshly wisdom about God. Wherefore many,
progressing after baptism, and especially those who have been
baptized in infancy or early youth, in proportion as their
intellect becomes clearer and brighter, while "the inward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
man is renewed day by day,"<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> throw away their former
opinions which they held about God while they were mocked
with vain imaginings, with scorn and horror and confession of
their mistake. And yet they are not therefore considered
not to have received baptism, or to have received baptism of
a kind corresponding to their error; but in them both the
perfection of the sacrament is honoured and the delusion of
their mind is corrected, even though it had become inveterate
through long confirmation, or been, perhaps, maintained in
many controversies. Wherefore even the heretic, who is
manifestly without, if he has there received baptism as ordained
in the gospel, has certainly not received baptism of a
kind corresponding to the error which blinds him. And
therefore, if returning into the way of wisdom, he perceives
that he ought to relinquish what he has held amiss, he must
not at the same time give up the good which he had received;
nor because his error is to be condemned, is the baptism of
Christ in him to be therefore extinguished. For it is already
sufficiently clear, from the case of those who happen to be
baptized within the Church with false views about God, that
the truth of the sacrament is to be distinguished from the
error of him who believes amiss, although both may be found
in the same man. And therefore, when any one grounded in
any error, even outside the Church, has yet been baptized with
the true sacrament, when he is restored to the unity of the
Church, a true baptism cannot take the place of a true baptism,
as a true faith takes the place of a false one, because a
thing cannot take the place of itself, since neither can it give
place. Heretics therefore join the Catholic Church to this
end, that what they have evil of themselves may be corrected,
not that what they have good of God should be repeated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xvi.</span>&mdash;23. Some one says, Does it then make no
difference, if two men, rooted in like error and wickedness, be
baptized without change of life or heart, one without, the
other within the Church? I acknowledge that there is a
difference. For he is worse who is baptized without, in addition
to his other sin,&mdash;not because of his baptism, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
but because he is without; for the evil of division is in itself
far from insignificant or trivial. Yet the difference exists
only if he who is baptized within has desired to be within
not for the sake of any earthly or temporal advantage, but
because he has preferred the unity of the Church spread
throughout the world to the divisions of schism; otherwise
he too must be considered among those who are without:
Let us therefore put the two cases in this way. Let us suppose
that the one, for the sake of argument, held the same
opinions as Photinus<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> about Christ, and was baptized in his
heresy outside the communion of the Catholic Church; and
that another held the same opinion, but was baptized in the
Catholic Church, believing that his view was really the
Catholic faith. I consider him as not yet a heretic, unless,
when the doctrine of the Catholic faith is made clear to him,
he chooses to resist it, and prefers that which he already
holds; and till this is the case, it is clear that he who was
baptized outside is the worse. And so in the one case
erroneous opinion alone, in the other the sin of schism also,
requires correction; but in neither of them is the truth of
the sacrament to be repeated. But if any one holds the
same view as the first, and knows that it is only in heresy
severed from the Church that such a view is taught or
learned, but yet for the sake of some temporal emolument
has desired to be baptized in the Catholic unity, or, having
been already baptized in it, is unwilling on account of the
said emolument to secede from it, he is not only to be considered
as seceding, but his offence is aggravated, in so far as
to the error of heresy and the division of unity he adds the
deceit of hypocrisy. Wherefore the depravity of each man,
in proportion as it is more dangerous and wanting in straightforwardness,
must be corrected with the more earnestness and
energy; and yet, if he has anything that is good in him,
especially if it be not of himself, but from God, we ought
not to think it of no value because of his depravity, or to
be blamed like it, or to be ascribed to it, rather than to His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
bountiful goodness, who even to a soul that plays the harlot,
and goes after her lovers, yet gives His bread, and His wine,
and His oil, and other food or ornaments, which are neither
from herself nor from her lovers, but from Him who in compassion
for her is even desirous to warn her to whom she
should return.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xvii.</span>&mdash;24. "Can the power of baptism," says Cyprian,
"be greater or better than confession? than martyrdom? that
a man should confess Christ before men, and be baptized in
his own blood? And yet," he goes on to say, "neither does
this baptism profit the heretic, even though for confessing
Christ he be put to death outside the Church."<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> This is
most true; for, by being put to death outside the Church, he
is proved not to have had charity, of which the apostle says,
"Though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity,
it profiteth me nothing."<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> But if martyrdom is of no avail
for this reason, because it has not charity, neither does it
profit those who, as Paul says, and Cyprian further sets forth,
are living within the Church without charity in envy and
malice; and yet they can both receive and transmit true
baptism. "Salvation," he says, "is not without the Church."[281]
Who says that it is? And therefore, whatever men have
that belongs to the Church, it profits them nothing towards
salvation outside the Church. But it is one thing not to
have, another to have so as to be of no use. He who has
not must be baptized that he may have; but he who has to
no avail must be corrected, that what he has may profit him.
Nor is the water in the baptism of heretics "adulterous,"[281]
because neither is the creature itself which God made evil, nor
is fault to be found with the words of the gospel in the mouths
of any who are astray; but the fault is theirs in whom there
is an adulterous spirit, even though it may receive the adornment
of the sacrament from a lawful spouse. Baptism therefore
can "be common to us and the heretics,"<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> just as the
gospel can be common to us, whatever difference there may
be between our faith and their error,&mdash;whether they think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
otherwise than the truth about the Father, or the Son, or
the Holy Spirit; or, being cut away from unity, do not gather
with Christ, but scatter abroad,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>&mdash;seeing that the sacrament
of baptism can be common to us, if we are the wheat of the
Lord, with the covetous within the Church, and with robbers,
and drunkards, and other pestilent persons of the same sort,
of whom it is said, "They shall not inherit the kingdom of
God,"<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> and yet the vices by which they are separated from
the kingdom of God are not shared by us.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xviii.</span>&mdash;25. Nor, indeed, is it of heresies alone that
the apostle says "that they which do such things shall not
inherit the kingdom of God." But it may be worth while to
look for a moment at the things which he groups together.
"The works of the flesh," he says, "are manifest, which are
these; adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry,
witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions,
heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such
like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you
in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit
the kingdom of God."<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Let us suppose some one, therefore,
chaste, continent, free from covetousness, no idolater, hospitable,
charitable to the needy, no man's enemy, not contentious,
patient, quiet, jealous of none, envying none, sober,
frugal, but a heretic; it is of course clear to all that for this
one fault only, that he is a heretic, he will fail to inherit
the kingdom of God. Let us suppose another, a fornicator,
unclean, lascivious, covetous, or even more openly given to
idolatry, a student of witchcraft, a lover of strife and contention,
envious, hot-tempered, seditious, jealous, drunken, and
a reveller, but a Catholic; can it be that for this sole merit,
that he is a Catholic, he will inherit the kingdom of God,
though his deeds are of the kind of which the apostle thus
concludes: "Of the which I tell you before, as I have also
told you in time past, that they which do such things shall
not inherit the kingdom of God?" If we say this, we lead
ourselves astray. For the word of God does not lead us
astray, which is neither silent, nor lenient, nor deceptive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
through any flattery. Indeed, it speaks to the same effect
elsewhere: "For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor
unclean person, nor covetous man, which is an idolater, hath
any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let
no man deceive you with vain words."<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> We have no reason,
therefore, to complain of the word of God. It certainly
says, and says openly and freely, that those who live a
wicked life have no part in the kingdom of God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xix.</span>&mdash;26. Let us therefore not flatter the Catholic
who is hemmed in with all these vices, nor venture, merely
because he is a Catholic Christian, to promise him the impunity
which holy Scripture does not promise him; nor, if he
has any one of the faults above mentioned, ought we to promise
him a partnership in that heavenly land. For, in writing to
the Corinthians, the apostle enumerates the several sins, under
each of which it is implicitly understood that it shall not inherit
the kingdom of God: "Be not deceived," he says:
"neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate,
nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves,
nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall
inherit the kingdom of God."<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> He does not say, those who
possess all these vices together shall not inherit the kingdom
of God; but neither these nor those: so that, as each is
named, you may understand that no one of them shall inherit
the kingdom of God. As, therefore, heretics shall not possess
the kingdom of God, so the covetous shall not inherit the
kingdom of God. Nor can we indeed doubt that the punishments
themselves, with which they shall be tortured who do
not inherit the kingdom of God, will vary in proportion to
the difference of their offences, and that some will be more
severe than others; so that in the eternal fire itself there will
be different tortures in the punishments, corresponding to the
different weights of guilt. For indeed it was not idly that
the Lord said, "It shall be more tolerable for the land of
Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee."<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> But yet, so
far as failing to inherit the kingdom of God is concerned, it
is just as certain, if you choose any one of the less heinous of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
these vices, as if you chose more than one, or some one
which you saw was more atrocious; and because those will
inherit the kingdom of God whom the Judge shall set on His
right hand, and for those who shall not be found worthy to
be set at the right hand nothing will remain but to be at the
left, no other announcement is left for them to hear like goats
from the mouth of the Shepherd, except, "Depart into everlasting
fire, prepared for the devil and his angels;"<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> though in
that fire, as I said before, it may be that different punishments
will be awarded corresponding to the difference of the sins.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xx.</span>&mdash;27. But on the question whether we ought
to prefer a Catholic of the most abandoned character to a
heretic in whose life, except that he is a heretic, men can
find nothing to blame, I do not venture to give a hasty judgment.
But if any one says, because he is a heretic, he cannot
be this only without other vices also following,&mdash;for he is
carnal and natural, and therefore must be also envious, and
hot-tempered, and jealous, and hostile to truth itself, and
utterly estranged from it,&mdash;let him fairly understand, that of
those other faults of which he is supposed to have chosen
some one less flagrant, a single one cannot exist by itself in
any man, because he in turn is carnal and natural; as, to
take the case of drunkenness, which people have now become
accustomed to talk of not only without horror, but with some
degree of merriment, can it possibly exist alone in any one in
whom it is found? For what drunkard is not also contentious,
and hot-tempered, and jealous, and at variance with
all soundness of counsel, and at grievous enmity with those
who rebuke him? Further, it is not easy for him to avoid
being a fornicator and adulterer, though he may be no heretic;
just as a heretic may be no drunkard, nor adulterer, nor fornicator,
nor lascivious, nor a lover of money, or given to witchcraft,
and cannot well be all these together. Nor indeed is
any one vice followed by all the rest. Supposing, therefore,
two men,&mdash;one a Catholic with all these vices, the other a
heretic free from all from which a heretic can be free,&mdash;although
they do not both contend against the faith, and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
each lives contrary to the faith, and each is deceived by a
vain hope, and each is far removed from charity of spirit,
and therefore each is severed from connection with the body
of the one dove; why do we recognise in one of them the
sacrament of Christ, and not in the other, as though it belonged
to this or that man, whilst really it is the same in
both, and belongs to God alone, and is good even in the worst
of men? And if of the men who have it, one is worse than
another, it does not follow that the sacrament which they
have is worse in the one than in the other, seeing that
neither in the case of two bad Catholics, if one be worse than
the other, does he possess a worse baptism, nor, if one of
them be good and another bad, is baptism bad in the bad one
and good in the good one; but it is good in both. Just as
the light of the sun, or even of a lamp, is certainly not less
brilliant when displayed to bad eyes than when seen by
better ones; but it is the same in the case of both, although
it either cheers or hurts them differently according to the
difference of their powers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxi.</span>&mdash;28. With regard to the objection brought
against Cyprian, that the catechumens who were seized in
martyrdom, and slain for Christ's name's sake, received a
crown even without baptism, I do not quite see what it has
to do with the matter, unless, indeed, they urged that heretics
could much more be admitted with baptism to Christ's kingdom,
to which catechumens were admitted without it, since
He Himself has said, "Except a man be born of water and of
the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Now,
in this matter I do not hesitate for a moment to place the
Catholic catechumen, who is burning with love for God, before
the baptized heretic; nor yet do we thereby do dishonour
to the sacrament of baptism which the latter has already
received, the former not as yet; nor do we consider that the
sacrament of the catechumen<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> is to be preferred to the sacra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>ment
of baptism, when we acknowledge that some catechumens
are better and more faithful than some baptized persons.
For the centurion Cornelius, before baptism, was better than
Simon, who had been baptized. For Cornelius, even before
his baptism, was filled with the Holy Spirit;<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Simon, even
after baptism, was puffed up with an unclean spirit.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Cornelius,
however, would have been convicted of contempt for
so holy a sacrament, if, even after he had received the Holy
Ghost, he had refused to be baptized. But when he was
baptized, he received in no wise a better sacrament than
Simon; but the different merits of the men were made manifest
under the equal holiness of the same sacrament,&mdash;so true
is it that the good or ill deserving of the recipient does not
increase or diminish the holiness of baptism. But as baptism
is wanting to a good catechumen to his receiving the kingdom
of heaven, so true conversion is wanting to a bad man though
baptized. For He who said, "Except a man be born of water
and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God,"
said also Himself, "Except your righteousness shall exceed
the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in
no case enter into the kingdom of heaven."<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> For that the
righteousness of the catechumens might not feel secure, it is
written, "Except a man be born again of water and of the
Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." And again,
that the unrighteousness of the baptized might not feel secure
because they had received baptism, it is written, "Except
your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes
and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of
heaven." The one were too little without the other; the two
make perfect the heir of that inheritance. As, then, we ought
not to depreciate a man's righteousness, which begins to exist
before he is joined to the Church, as the righteousness of Cor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>nelius
began to exist before he was in the body of Christian
men,&mdash;which righteousness was not thought worthless, or the
angel would not have said to him, "Thy prayers and thine
alms are come up as a memorial before God;" nor did it yet
suffice for his obtaining the kingdom of heaven, or he would
not have been told to send to Peter,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>&mdash;so neither ought we to
depreciate the sacrament of baptism, even though it has been
received outside the Church. But since it is of no avail for
salvation unless he who has baptism indeed in full perfection
be incorporated into the Church, correcting also his own depravity,
let us therefore correct the error of the heretics, that
we may recognise what in them is not their own but Christ's.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxii.</span>&mdash;29. That the place of baptism is sometimes
supplied by martyrdom is supported by an argument by no
means trivial, which the blessed Cyprian adduces<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> from the
thief, to whom, though he was not baptized, it was yet said,
"To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise."<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> On considering
which again and again, I find that not only martyrdom for the
sake of Christ may supply what was wanting of baptism, but
also faith and conversion of heart, if recourse may not be had
to the celebration of the mystery of baptism for want of time.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
For neither was that thief crucified for the name of Christ,
but as the reward of his own deeds; nor did he suffer because
he believed, but he believed while suffering. It was shown,
therefore, in the case of that thief, how great is the power,
even without the visible sacrament of baptism, of what the
apostle says, "With the heart man believes unto righteousness,
and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> But
the want is supplied invisibly only when the administration
of baptism is prevented, not by contempt for religion, but by
the necessity of the moment. For much more in the case of
Cornelius and his friends, than in the case of that robber,
might it seem superfluous that they should also be baptized
with water, seeing that in them the gift of the Holy Spirit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
which, according to the testimony of holy Scripture, was
received by other men only after baptism, had made itself
manifest by every unmistakeable sign appropriate to those
times when they spoke with tongues. Yet they were baptized,
and for this action we have the authority of an apostle as
the warrant. So far ought all of us to be from being induced
by any perfection in the inner man, if it so happen that before
baptism a person has advanced, through the workings of a
pious heart, to spiritual understanding, to despise a sacrament
which is applied to the body by the hands of the minister,
but which is God's own means for working spiritually a man's
dedication to Himself. Nor do I conceive that the function
of baptizing was assigned to John, so that it should be called
John's baptism, for any other reason except that the Lord
Himself, who had appointed it, in not disdaining to receive
the baptism of His servant,<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> might consecrate the path of
humility, and show most plainly by such an action how high
a value was to be placed on His own baptism, with which He
Himself was afterwards to baptize. For He saw, like an
excellent physician of eternal salvation, that overweening
pride would be found in some, who, having made such progress
in the understanding of the truth and in uprightness of
character that they would not hesitate to place themselves,
both in life and knowledge, above many that were baptized,
would think it was unnecessary for them to be baptized, since
they felt that they had attained a frame of mind to which
many that were baptized were still only endeavouring to raise
themselves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxiii.</span>&mdash;30. But what is the precise value of the
sanctification of the sacrament (which that thief did not receive,
not from any want of will on his part, but because it was unavoidably
omitted), and what is the effect on a man of its
material application, it is not easy to say. Still, had it not
been of the greatest value, the Lord would not have received
the baptism of a servant. But since we must look at it in
itself without entering upon the question of the salvation of
the recipient, which it is intended to work, it shows clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
enough that both in the bad, and in those who renounce the
world in word and not in deed, it is itself complete, though
they cannot receive salvation unless they amend their lives.
But as in the thief, to whom the material administration of
the sacrament was necessarily wanting, the salvation was complete,
because it was spiritually present through his piety, so,
when the sacrament itself is present, salvation is complete, if
what the thief possessed be unavoidably wanting. And this
is the firm tradition of the universal Church, in respect of the
baptism of infants, who certainly are as yet unable "with the
heart to believe unto righteousness, and with the mouth to
make confession unto salvation," as the thief could do; nay,
who even, by crying and moaning when the mystery is performed
upon them, raise their voices in opposition to the
mysterious words, and yet no Christian will say that they are
baptized to no purpose.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxiv.</span>&mdash;31. And if any one seek for divine authority
in this matter, though what is held by the whole Church, and
that not as instituted by Councils, but as a matter of invariable
custom, is rightly held to have been handed down by
apostolical authority, still we can form a true conjecture of
the value of the sacrament of baptism in the case of infants,
from the parallel of circumcision, which was received by God's
earlier people, and before receiving which Abraham was justified,
as Cornelius also was enriched with the gift of the Holy Spirit
before he was baptized. Yet the apostle says of Abraham
himself, that "he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of
the righteousness of faith," having already believed in his
heart, so that "it was counted unto him for righteousness."<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
Why, therefore, was it commanded him that he should circumcise
every male child in order on the eighth day,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> though
it could not yet believe with the heart, that it should be
counted unto it for righteousness, unless because the sacrament
in itself was of great avail? And this was made manifest
by the message of an angel in the case of Moses' son;
for when he was carried by his mother, being yet uncircumcised,
it was required, by manifest present peril, that he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
be circumcised,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> and when this was done, the danger of
death was removed. As therefore in Abraham the justification
of faith came first, and circumcision was added afterwards
as the seal of faith; so in Cornelius the spiritual sanctification
came first in the gift of the Holy Spirit, and the sacrament
of regeneration was added afterwards in the laver of
baptism. And as in Isaac, who was circumcised on the
eighth day after his birth, the seal of this righteousness of
faith was given first, and afterwards, as he imitated the faith
of his father, the righteousness itself followed as he grew up,
of which the seal had been given before when he was an
infant; so in infants, who are baptized, the sacrament of regeneration
is given first, and if they maintain a Christian
piety, conversion also in the heart will follow, of which the
mysterious sign had gone before in the outward body. And
as in the thief the gracious goodness of the Almighty supplied
what had been wanting in the sacrament of baptism,
because it had been missing not from pride or contempt, but
from want of opportunity; so in infants who die baptized, we
must believe that the same grace of the Almighty supplies
the want, that, not from perversity of will, but from insufficiency
of age, they can neither believe with the heart unto
righteousness, nor make confession with the mouth unto salvation.
Therefore, when others take the vows for them, that the
celebration of the sacrament may be complete in their behalf,
it is unquestionably of avail for their dedication to God, because
they cannot answer for themselves. But if another
were to answer for one who could answer for himself, it would
not be of the same avail. In accordance with which rule, we
find in the gospel what strikes every one as natural when he
reads it, "He is of age, he shall speak for himself."<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxv.</span>&mdash;32. By all these considerations it is proved
that the sacrament of baptism is one thing, the conversion of
the heart another; but that man's salvation is made complete
through the two together. Nor are we to suppose that, if one
of these be wanting, it necessarily follows that the other is
wanting also; because the sacrament may exist in the infant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
without the conversion of the heart; and this was found to be
possible without the sacrament in the case of the thief, God
in either case filling up what was involuntarily wanting. But
when either of these requisites is wanting intentionally, then
the man is responsible for the omission. And baptism may
exist when the conversion of the heart is wanting; but, with
respect to such conversion, it may indeed be found when
baptism has not been received, but never when it has been
despised. Nor can there be said in any way to be a turning
of the heart to God when the sacrament of God is treated
with contempt. Therefore we are right in censuring, anathematizing,
abhorring, and abominating the perversity of heart
shown by heretics; yet it does not follow that they have not
the sacrament of the gospel, because they have not what
makes it of avail. Wherefore, when they come to the true
faith, and by penitence seek remission of their sins, we are
not flattering or deceiving them, when we instruct them by
heavenly discipline for the kingdom of heaven, correcting
and reforming in them their errors and perverseness, to the
intent that we may by no means do violence to what is sound
in them, nor, because of man's fault, declare that anything
which he may have in him from God is either valueless or
faulty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxvi.</span>&mdash;33. A few things still remain to be noticed
in the epistle to Jubaianus; but since these will raise the
question both of the past custom of the Church and of the
baptism of John, which is wont to excite no small doubt in
those who pay slight attention to a matter which is sufficiently
obvious, seeing that those who had received the baptism of
John were commanded by the apostle to be baptized again,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>

<blockquote>

<p><small>HE EXAMINES THE LAST PART OF THE EPISTLE OF CYPRIAN TO JUBAIANUS,
TOGETHER WITH HIS EPISTLE TO QUINTUS, THE LETTER OF THE AFRICAN
SYNOD TO THE NUMIDIAN BISHOPS, AND CYPRIAN'S EPISTLE TO POMPEIUS.</small></p></blockquote>


<p class="cap">CHAP. I.&mdash;1. We have the testimony of the blessed
Cyprian, that the custom of the Catholic Church is at
present retained, when men coming from the side of heretics
or schismatics, if they have received baptism as consecrated
in the words of the gospel, are not baptized afresh. For he
himself proposed to himself the question, and that as coming
from the mouth of brethren either seeking the truth or contending
for the truth. For in the course of the arguments
by which he wished to show that heretics should be baptized
again, which we have sufficiently considered for our present
purpose in the former books, he says: "But some will say,
What then will become of those who in times past, coming to
the Church from heresy, were admitted without baptism?"<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
In this question is involved the shipwreck of the whole cause
of the Donatists, with whom our contest is on this point.
For if those had not really baptism who were thus received
on coming from heretics, and their sins were still upon them,
then, when such men were admitted to communion, either by
Cyprian himself, or by those who came before him, we must
acknowledge that one of two things occurred,&mdash;either that the
Church perished then and there from the pollution of communion
with such men, or that any one abiding in unity is
not injured by even the notorious sins of other men. But
since they cannot say that the Church then perished through
the contamination arising from communion with those who,
as Cyprian says, were admitted into it without baptism,&mdash;for
otherwise they cannot maintain the validity of their own origin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
if the Church then perished, seeing that the list of consuls
proves that more than forty years elapsed between the martyrdom
of Cyprian and the burning of the sacred books,<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> from
which they took occasion to make a schism, spreading abroad
the smoke of their calumnies,&mdash;it therefore is left for them
to acknowledge that the unity of Christ is not polluted by
any such communion, even with known offenders. And, after
this confession, they will be unable to discover any reason
which will justify them in maintaining that they were bound
to separate from the churches of the whole world, which, as
we read, were equally founded by the apostles, seeing that,
while the others could not have perished from any admixture
of offenders, of whatsoever kind, they, though they would not
have perished if they had remained in unity with them,
brought destruction on themselves in schism, by separating
themselves from their brethren, and breaking the bond of
peace. For the sacrilege of schism is most clearly evident in
them, if they had no sufficient cause for separation. And it
is clear that there was no sufficient cause for separation, if
even the presence of notorious offenders cannot pollute the
good while they abide in unity. But that the good, abiding
in unity, are not polluted even by notorious offenders, we
teach on the testimony of Cyprian, who says that "men in
past times, coming to the Church from heresy, were admitted
without baptism;" and yet, if the wickedness of their sacrilege,
which was still upon them, seeing it had not been purged
away by baptism, could not pollute and destroy the holiness
of the Church, it cannot perish by any infection from wicked
men. Wherefore, if they allow that Cyprian spoke the truth,
they are convicted of schism on his testimony; if they maintain
that he does not speak truth, let them not use his testimony
on the question of baptism.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ii.</span>&mdash;2. But now that we have begun a disputation
with a man of peace like Cyprian, let us go on. For when he
had brought an objection against himself, which he knew
was urged by his brethren, "What then will become of those
who in times past, coming to the Church from heresy, were ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>mitted
without baptism? The Lord," he answers, "is able of
His mercy to grant indulgence, and not to separate from the
gifts of His Church those who, being admitted in all honesty
to His Church, have fallen asleep within the Church." Well
indeed has he assumed that charity can cover the multitude
of sins. But if they really had baptism, and this were not
rightly perceived by those who thought that they should be
baptized again, that error was covered by the charity of unity
so long as it contained, not the discord and spirit of the devil,
but merely human infirmity, until, as the apostle says, "if they
were otherwise minded, the Lord should reveal it to them."<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
But woe unto those who, being torn asunder from unity by a
sacrilegious rupture, either rebaptize, if baptism exists with
both us and them, or do not baptize at all, if baptism exist
in the Catholic Church only. Whether, therefore, they rebaptize,
or fail to baptize, they are not in the bond of peace;
wherefore let them apply a remedy to which they please of
these two wounds. But if we admit to the Church without
baptism, we are of the number of those who, as Cyprian has
assumed, may receive pardon because they preserved unity.
But if (as is, I think, already clear from what has been said
in the earlier books) Christian baptism can preserve its integrity
even amid the perversity of heretics, then even though
any in those times did rebaptize, yet without departing from
the bond of unity, they might still attain to pardon in virtue
of that same love of peace, through which Cyprian bears
witness that those admitted even without baptism might
obtain that they should not be separated from the gifts of the
Church. Further, if it is true that with heretics and schismatics
the baptism of Christ does not exist, how much less
could the sins of others hurt those who were fixed in unity,
if even men's own sins were forgiven when they came to it
even without baptism! For if, according to Cyprian, the bond
of unity is of such efficacy, how could they be hurt by other
men's sins, who were unwilling to separate themselves from
unity, if even the unbaptized, who wished to come to it from
heresy, thereby escaped the destruction due to their own
sins?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. iii.</span>&mdash;3. But in what Cyprian adds, saying, "Nor yet
because men once have erred must there be always error,
since it rather befits wise and God-fearing men gladly and
unhesitatingly to follow truth, when it is clearly laid before
their eyes, than obstinately and persistently to fight for heretics
against their brethren and their fellow-priests," he is
uttering the most perfect truth; and the man who resists the
manifest truth is opposing himself rather than his neighbours.
But, so far as I can judge, it is perfectly clear and certain, from
the many arguments which I have already adduced, that the
baptism of Christ cannot be invalidated even by the perversity
of heretics, when it is given or received among them.
But, granting that it is not yet certain, at any rate no one who
has considered what has been said, even from a hostile point
of view, will assert that the question has been decided the
other way. Therefore we are not striving against manifest
truth, but either, as I think, we are striving in behalf of what is
clearly true, or, at any rate, as those may hold who think that
the question has not yet been solved, we are seeking for the
truth. And therefore, if the truth be other than we think,
yet we are receiving those baptized by heretics with the same
honesty of heart with which those received them whom
Cyprian supposed, in virtue of their cleaving to the unity of
the Church, to be capable of pardon. But if the baptism of
Christ, as is indicated by the many arguments used above,
can retain its integrity amid any defect either of life or faith,
whether on the part of those who seem to be within, and yet
do not belong to the members of the one dove, or on the part
of those whose severance from her extends to being openly
without, then those who sought its repetition in those former
days deserved the same pardon for their charity in clinging to
unity, which Cyprian thought that those deserved for charity
of the same kind whom he believed to have been admitted
without baptism. They therefore who, without any cause
(since, as Cyprian himself shows, the bad cannot hurt the
good in the unity of the Church), have cut themselves off
from the charity which is shown in this unity, have lost all
place of pardon, and whilst they would incur destruction by
the very crime of schism, even though they did not rebaptize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
those who had been baptized in the Catholic Church, of how
bitter punishment are they deserving, who are either endeavouring
to give to the Catholics who have it what Cyprian
affirms that they themselves have not, or, as is clear from the
facts of the case, are bringing as a charge against the Catholic
Church that she has not what even they themselves possess?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. iv.</span>&mdash;4. But since now, as I said before, we have
begun a disputation with the epistles of Cyprian, I think
that I should not seem even to him, if he were present, "to
be contending obstinately and persistently in defence of heretics
against my brethren and my fellow-priests," when he
learned the powerful reasons which move us to believe that
even among heretics, who are perversely obstinate in their
malignant error, the baptism of Christ is yet in itself most
holy, and most highly to be reverenced. And seeing that he
himself, whose testimony has such weight with us, bears witness
that they were wont in past times to be admitted without
a second baptism, I would have any one, who is induced by
Cyprian's arguments to hold it as certain that heretics ought
to be baptized afresh, yet consider that those who, on account
of the weight of the arguments on the other side, are not as
yet persuaded that this should be so, hold the same place
as those in past time, who in all honesty admitted men who
were baptized in heresy on the simple correction of their
individual error, and who were capable of salvation with them
in virtue of the bond of unity. And let any one, who is led
by the past custom of the Church, and by the subsequent
authority of a general Council, and by so many powerful proofs
from holy Scripture, and by much evidence from Cyprian
himself, and by the clear reasoning of truth, to understand
that the baptism of Christ, consecrated in the words of the
gospel, cannot be perverted by the error of any man on earth,&mdash;let
such an one understand, that they who then thought
otherwise, but yet preserved their charity, can be saved by the
same bond of unity. And herein he should also understand
of those who, in the society of the Church dispersed
throughout the world, could not have been defiled by any
tares, by any chaff, so long as they themselves desired to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
fruitful corn, and who therefore severed themselves from the
same bond of unity without any cause for the divorce, that
at any rate, whichever of the two opinions be true,&mdash;that
which Cyprian then held, or that which was maintained by
the universal voice of the Catholic Church, which Cyprian
did not abandon,&mdash;in either case they, having most openly
placed themselves outside in the plain sacrilege of schism,
cannot possibly be saved, and all that they possess of the
holy sacraments, and of the free gifts of the one legitimate
Bridegroom, is of avail, while they continue what they are,
for their confusion rather than the salvation of their souls.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. v.</span>&mdash;5. Wherefore, even if heretics should be truly
anxious to correct their error and come to the Church, for the
very reason that they believed that they had no baptism
unless they received it in the Church, even under these circumstances
we should not be bound to yield to their desire
for the repetition of baptism; but rather they should be
taught, on the one hand, that baptism, though perfect in
itself, could in no way profit their perversity if they would
not submit to be corrected; and, on the other hand, that the
perfection of baptism could not be impaired by their perversity,
while refusing to be corrected: and again, that no
further perfection is added to baptism in them because they
are submitting to correction; but that, while they themselves
are quitting their iniquity, that which was before within them
to their destruction is now beginning to be of profit for salvation.
For, learning this, they will both recognise the need of
salvation in Catholic unity, and will cease to claim as their
own what is really Christ's, and will not confound the sacrament
of truth, although existing in themselves, with their own
individual error.</p>

<p>6. To this we may add a further reason, that men, by a
sort of hidden inspiration from heaven, shrink from any one
who for the second time receives baptism which he had
already received in any quarter whatsoever, insomuch that
the very heretics themselves, when their arguments start with
that subject, rub their forehead in perplexity, and almost all
their laity, even those who have grown old in their body, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
have conceived an obstinate animosity against the Catholic
Church, confess that this one point in their system displeases
them; and many who, for the sake of gaining some secular
advantage, or avoiding some disadvantage, wish to secede to
them, strive with many secret efforts that they may have
granted to them, as a peculiar and individual privilege, that
they should not be rebaptized; and some, who are led to place
credence in their other vain delusions and false accusations
against the Catholic Church, are recalled to unity by this one
consideration, that they are unwilling to associate with them
lest they should be compelled to be rebaptized. And the
Donatists, through fear of this feeling, which has so thorough
possession of all men's hearts, have consented to acknowledge
the baptism which was conferred among the followers of
Maximianus, whom they had condemned, and so to cut short
their own tongues and close their mouths, in preference to
baptizing again so many men of the people of Musti, and
Assur√¶, and other districts, whom they received with Felicianus
and Pr√¶textatus, and the others who had been condemned
by them and afterwards returned to them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. vi.</span>&mdash;7. For when this is done occasionally in the
case of individuals, at great intervals of time and space, the
enormity of the deed is not equally felt; but if all were suddenly
to be brought together who had been baptized in course
of time by the aforesaid followers of Maximianus, either under
pressure of the peril of death or at their Easter solemnities,
and it were told them that they must be baptized again,
because what they had already received in the sacrilege of
schism was null and void, they might indeed say what
obstinate perseverance in their error would compel them to
say, that they might hide the rigour and iciness of their
hardness under any kind of false shade of consistency against
the warmth of truth. But in fact, because the party of Maximianus
could not bear this, and because the very men who
would have to enforce it could not endure what must needs
have been done in the case of so many men at once, especially
as those very men would be rebaptizing them in the party of
Primianus who had already baptized them in the party of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Maximianus, for these reasons their baptism was received, and
the pride of the Donatists was cut short. And this course
they would certainly not have chosen to adopt, had they not
thought that more harm would have been done to their cause
by the offence men would have taken at the repetition of the
baptism, than by the reputation lost in abandoning their defence.
And this I would not say with any idea that we
ought to be restrained by consideration of human feelings, if
the truth compelled those who came from heretics to be baptized
afresh. But because the holy Cyprian says, "that heretics
might have been all the more impelled to the necessity of
coming over, if only they were to be rebaptized in the Catholic
Church,"<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> on this account I have wished to place on record
the intensity of the repugnance to this act which is seated
deeply in the heart of nearly every one,&mdash;a repugnance which
I can believe was inspired by God Himself, that the Church
might be fortified by the instinct of repugnance against any
possible arguments which the weak cannot dispel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. vii.</span>&mdash;8. Truly, when I look at the actual words of
Cyprian, I am warned to say some things which are very
necessary for the solution of this question. "For if they
were to see," he says, "that it was settled and established
by our formal decision and vote, that the baptism with
which they are baptized in heresy is considered just and
lawful, they will think that they are in just and lawful
possession of the Church also, and all its other gifts." He
does not say "that they will think they are in possession,"
but "in just and lawful possession of the gifts of the Church."
But we say that we cannot allow that they are <i>in just and
lawful</i> possession of baptism. That they are in possession of
it we cannot deny, when we recognise the sacrament of the
Lord in the words of the gospel. They have therefore lawful
baptism, but they do not have it lawfully. For whosoever has
it both in Catholic unity, and living worthily of it, both has
lawful baptism and has it lawfully; but whosoever has it
either within the Catholic Church itself, as chaff mixed with
the wheat, or outside, as chaff carried away by the wind, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
indeed lawful baptism, but not lawfully. For he has it as he
uses it. But the man does not use it lawfully who uses it
against the law,&mdash;which every one does, who, being baptized,
yet leads an abandoned life, whether inside or without the
Church.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. viii.</span>&mdash;9. Wherefore, as the apostle said of the law,
"The law is good, if a man use it lawfully,"<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> so we may
fairly say of baptism, Baptism is good, if a man use it lawfully.
And as they who used the law unlawfully could not
in that case cause that it should not be in itself good, or
make it null and void, so any one who uses baptism unlawfully,
either because he lives in heresy, or because he lives
the worst of lives, yet cannot cause that the baptism should
be otherwise than good, or altogether null and void. And so,
when he is converted either to Catholic unity, or to a mode
of living worthy of so great a sacrament, he begins to have
not another and a lawful baptism, but that same baptism in
a lawful manner. Nor does the remission of irrevocable sins
follow on baptism, unless a man not only have lawful
baptism, but have it lawfully; and yet it does not follow
that if a man have it not lawfully, so that his sins are either
not remitted, or, being remitted, are brought on him again,
therefore the sacrament of baptism should be in the baptized
person either bad or null and void. For as Judas, to whom
the Lord gave a morsel, gave a place within himself to the
devil, not by receiving what was bad, but by receiving it
badly,<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> so each person, on receiving the sacrament of the
Lord, does not cause that it is bad because he is bad himself,
or that he has received nothing because he has not
received it to salvation. For it was none the less the body
of the Lord and the blood of the Lord, even in those to
whom the apostle said, "He that eateth unworthily, eateth
and drinketh damnation to himself."<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Let the heretics
therefore seek in the Catholic Church not what they have,
but what they have not,&mdash;that is, the end of the commandment,
without which many holy things may be possessed, but
they cannot profit. "Now, the end of the commandment is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of
faith unfeigned."<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Let them therefore hasten to the unity
and truth of the Catholic Church, not that they may have
the sacrament of washing, if they have been already bathed
in it, although in heresy, but that they may have it to their
health.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ix.</span>&mdash;10. Now we must see what is said of the
baptism of John. For "we read in the Acts of the Apostles,
that those who had already been baptized with the baptism
of John were yet baptized by Paul,"<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> simply because the
baptism of John was not the baptism of Christ, but a baptism
allowed by Christ to John, so as to be called especially
John's baptism; as the same John says, "A man can receive
nothing, except it be given him from heaven."<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> And that
he might not possibly seem to receive this from God the
Father in such wise as not to receive it from the Son, speaking
presently of Christ Himself, he says, "Of His fulness have
we all received."<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> But by the grace of a certain dispensation
John received this, which was to last not for long, but only
long enough to prepare for the Lord the way in which he
must needs be the forerunner. And as our Lord was presently
to enter on this way with all humility, and to lead those
who humbly followed Him to perfection, as He washed the
feet of His servants,<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> so was He willing to be baptized with the
baptism of a servant.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> For as He set Himself to minister to
the feet of those whose guide He was Himself, so He submitted
Himself to the gift of John which He Himself had
given, that all might understand what sacrilegious arrogance
they would show in despising the baptism which they ought
each of them to receive from the Lord, when the Lord Himself
accepted what He Himself had bestowed upon a servant,
that he might give it as his own; and that when John, than
whom no greater had arisen among them that are born of
women,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> bore such testimony to Christ, as to confess that he
was not worthy to unloose the latchet of His shoe,<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
might both, by receiving his baptism, be found to be the
humblest among men, and, by taking away the place for the
baptism of John, be believed to be the most high God, at
once the teacher of humility and the giver of exaltation.</p>

<p>11. For to none of the prophets, to no one at all in holy
Scripture, do we read that it was granted to baptize in the
water of repentance for the remission of sins, as it was
granted to John; that, causing the hearts of the people to
hang upon him through this marvellous grace, he might
prepare in them the way for Him whom he declared to be
so infinitely greater than himself. But the Lord Jesus
Christ cleanses His Church by such a baptism that on
receiving it no other is required; while John gave a first
washing with such a baptism that on receiving it there was
further need of the baptism of the Lord,&mdash;not that the first
baptism should be repeated, but that the baptism of Christ,
for whom he was preparing the way, might be further bestowed
on those who had received the baptism of John.
For if Christ's humility were not to be commended to our
notice, neither would there be any need of the baptism of
John; again, if the end were in John, after his baptism
there would be no need of the baptism of Christ. But
because "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to
every one that believeth,"<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> it was shown by John to whom
men should go, and in whom, when they had reached Him,
they should rest. The same John, therefore, set forth both
the exalted nature of the Lord, when he placed Him far
before himself, and His humility, when he baptized Him as
the lowest of the people. But if John had baptized Christ
alone, he would be thought to have been the dispenser of a
better baptism, in that with which Christ alone was baptized,
than the baptism of Christ with which Christians are baptized;
and again, if all ought to be baptized first with the baptism
of John, and then with that of Christ, the baptism of Christ
would deservedly seem to be lacking in fulness and perfection,
as not sufficing for salvation. Wherefore the Lord was
baptized with the baptism of John, that He might bend the
proud necks of men to His own health-giving baptism; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
He was not alone baptized with it, lest He should show His
own to be inferior to this, with which none but He Himself
had deserved to be baptized; and He did not allow it to continue
longer, lest the one baptism with which He baptizes
might seem to need the other to precede it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. x.</span>&mdash;12. I ask, therefore, if sins were remitted by the
baptism of John, what more could the baptism of Christ confer
on those whom the Apostle Paul desired to be baptized with
the baptism of Christ after they had received the baptism of
John? But if sins were not remitted by the baptism of John,
were those men in the days of Cyprian better than John, of
whom he says himself that they "used to seize on estates by
treacherous frauds, and increase their gains by accumulated
usuries,"<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> through whose administration of baptism the remission
of sins was yet conferred? Or was it because they were
contained within the unity of the Church? What then? Was
John not contained within that unity, the friend of the Bridegroom,
the preparer of the way of the Lord, the baptizer of the
Lord Himself? Who will be mad enough to assert this?
Wherefore, although my belief is that John so baptized with
the water of repentance for the remission of sins, that those
who were baptized by him received the expectation of the
remission of their sins, the actual remission taking place in
the baptism of the Lord,&mdash;just as the resurrection which is
expected at the last day is fulfilled in hope in us, as the
apostle says, that "He hath raised us up together, and made
us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus;"<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> and
again, "For we are saved by hope;"<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> or as again John himself,
while he says, "I indeed baptize you with water unto
repentance, for the remission of your sins,"<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> yet says, on seeing
our Lord, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away
the sin of the world,"<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>&mdash;nevertheless I am not disposed to
contend vehemently against any one who maintains that sins
were remitted even in the baptism of John, but that some
fuller sanctification was conferred by the baptism of Christ on
those whom Paul ordered to be baptized anew.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xi.</span>&mdash;13. For we must look at the point which especially
concerns the matter before us (whatever be the nature
of the baptism of John, since it is clear that he belongs to
the unity of Christ), viz., what is the reason for which it
was right that men should be baptized again after receiving
the baptism of the holy John, and why they ought not to be
baptized again after receiving the baptism of the covetous
bishops. For no one denies that in the Lord's field John
was as wheat, bearing an hundred-fold, if that be the highest
rate of increase; also no one doubts that covetousness, which
is idolatry, is reckoned in the Lord's harvest among the chaff.
Why then is a man baptized again after receiving baptism
from the wheat, and not after receiving it from the chaff? If
it was because he was better than John that Paul baptized
after John, why did not also Cyprian baptize after his usurious
colleagues, than whom he was better beyond all comparison?
If it was because they were in unity with him that he did not
baptize after such colleagues, neither ought Paul to have baptized
after John, because they were joined together in the
same unity. Can it be that defrauders and extortioners belong
to the members of that one dove, and that he does not belong
to it to whom the full power of the Lord Jesus Christ was
shown by the appearance of the Holy Spirit in the form of a
dove?<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Truly he belongs most closely to it; but the others,
who must be separated from it either by the occasion of some
scandal, or by the winnowing at the last day, do not by any
means belong to it, and yet baptism was repeated after John
and not after them. What then is the cause, except that the
baptism which Paul ordered them to receive was not the same
as that which was given at the hands of John? And so in
the same unity of the Church, the baptism of Christ cannot
be repeated though it be given by an usurious minister; but
those who receive the baptism of John, even from the hands
of John himself, ought to be afterwards baptized with the
baptism of Christ.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xii.</span>&mdash;14. Accordingly, I too might use the words of
the blessed Cyprian to turn the hearts of those that hear me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
to the consideration of something truly marvellous, if I were
to say "that John, who was accounted greater among the
prophets,&mdash;he who was filled with divine grace while yet in
his mother's womb; he who was upheld in the spirit and
power of Elias; who was not the adversary, but a forerunner
and herald of the Lord; who not only foretold our Lord in
words, but also showed Him to the sight; who baptized Christ
Himself, through whom all others are baptized,"<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>&mdash;he was not
worthy to baptize in such wise that those who were baptized
by him should not be baptized again after him; and shall no
one think that a man should be baptized in the Church after
he had been baptized by the covetous, by defrauders, by extortioners,
by usurers? Is not the answer ready to this invidious
question, Why do you think this unmeet, as though
either John were dishonoured, or the covetous man honoured?
But His baptism ought not to be repeated, of whom John
says, "The same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
For whoever be the minister by whose hands it is given, it
is His baptism of whom it was said, "The same is He which
baptizeth." But neither was the baptism of John himself
repeated, when the Apostle Paul commanded those who had
been baptized by him to be baptized in Christ. For what
they had not received from the friend of the Bridegroom, this
it was right that they should receive from the Bridegroom
Himself, of whom that friend had said, "The same is He
which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xiii.</span>&mdash;15. For the Lord Jesus might, if He had so
thought fit, have given the power of His baptism to some one
or more of His chief servants, whom He had already made His
friends, such as those to whom He says, "Henceforth I call
you not servants, but friends;"<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> that, as Aaron was shown to
be the priest by the rod that budded,<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> so in His Church, when
more and greater miracles are performed, the ministers of more
excellent holiness, and the dispensers of His mysteries, might
be made manifest by some sign, as those who alone ought to
baptize. But if this had been done, then though the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
of baptizing were given them by the Lord, yet it would necessarily
be called their own baptism, as in the case of the
baptism of John. And so Paul gives thanks to God that he
baptized none of those men who, as though forgetting in whose
name they had been baptized, were for dividing themselves
into factions under the names of different individuals.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> For
when baptism is as valid at the hands of a contemptible man
as it was when given by an apostle, it is recognised as the
baptism neither of this man nor of that, but of Christ; as
John bears witness that he learned, in the case of the Lord
Himself, through the appearance of the dove. For in what
other respect he said, "And I knew Him not," I cannot
clearly see. For if he had not known Him in any sense, he
could not have said to Him when He came to his baptism,
"I have need to be baptized of Thee."<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> What is it, therefore,
that he says, "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven
like a dove, and it abode on Him. And I knew Him not:
but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said
unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending,
and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizeth with
the Holy Ghost?"<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> The dove clearly descended on Him after
He was baptized. But while He was yet coming to be baptized,
John had said, "I have need to be baptized of Thee."
He therefore already knew Him. What does he therefore
mean by the words, "I knew Him not: but He that sent me
to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom
thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him,
the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost," since
this took place after He was baptized, unless it were that he
knew Him in respect of certain attributes, and in respect of
others knew Him not? He knew Him, indeed, as the Son of
God, the Bridegroom, of whose fulness all should receive;
but whereas of His fulness he himself had so received the
power of baptizing that it should be called the baptism of
John, he did not know whether He would so give it to others
also, or whether He would have His own baptism in such
wise, that at whose soever hands it was given, whether by a man
that brought forth fruit a hundred-fold, or sixty-fold, or thirty-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>fold,
whether by the wheat or by the chaff, it should be known
to be of Him alone; and this he learned through the Spirit
descending like a dove, and abiding on Him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xiv.</span>&mdash;16. Accordingly we find the apostles using
the expressions, "My glorying,"<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> though it was certainly in
the Lord; and "Mine office,"<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> and "My knowledge,"<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> and
"My gospel,"<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> although it was confessedly bestowed and given
by the Lord; but no one of them ever once said, "My baptism."
For neither is the glorying of all of them equal, nor
do they all minister with equal powers, nor are they all endowed
with equal knowledge, and in preaching the gospel one
works more forcibly than another, and so one may be said to
be more learned than another in the doctrine of salvation
itself; but one cannot be said to be more or less baptized
than another, whether he be baptized by a greater or a less
worthy minister. So when "the works of the flesh are manifest,
which are these; adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations,
strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings,
and such like;"<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> if it be strange that it should be
said, "Men were baptized after John, and are not baptized after
heretics," why is it not equally strange that it should be said,
"Men were baptized after John, and are not baptized after
the envious," seeing that Cyprian himself bears witness in his
epistle concerning envy and malignity that the covetous are
of the party of the devil, and Cyprian himself makes it manifest
from the words of the Apostle Paul, as we have shown
above, that in the time of the apostles themselves there were
envious persons in the Church of Christ among the very
preachers of the name of Christ?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xv.</span>&mdash;17. That therefore the baptism of John was
not the same as the baptism of Christ, has, I think, been
shown with sufficient clearness; and therefore no argument
can be drawn from it that baptism should be repeated after
heretics because it was repeated after John: since John was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
not a heretic, and could have a baptism, which, though granted
by Christ, was yet not the very baptism of Christ, seeing
that he had the love of Christ; while a heretic can have at
once the baptism of Christ and the perversity of the devil, as
another within the Church may have at once the baptism of
Christ and the envy of the devil.</p>

<p>18. But it will be urged that baptism after a heretic is
much more required, because John was not a heretic, and
yet baptism was repeated after him. On this principle, a man
may say, much more must we rebaptize after a drunkard, because
John was sober, and yet baptism was repeated after
him. And we shall have no answer to make to such a man,
save that the baptism of Christ was given to those who were
baptized by John, because they had it not; but where men
have the baptism of Christ, no iniquity on their part can possibly
effect that the baptism of Christ should fail to be in
them.</p>

<p>19. It is not therefore true that "by baptizing first, the
heretic obtains the right of baptism;"<a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> but because he did
not baptize with his own baptism, and though he did not
possess the right of baptizing, yet that which he gave is
Christ's, and he who received it is Christ's. For many things
are given wrongfully, and yet they are not therefore said
to be non-existent or not given at all. For neither does
he who renounces the world in word only and not in deed
receive baptism lawfully, and yet he does receive it. For
both Cyprian records that there were such men in the
Church in his day, and we ourselves experience and lament
the fact.</p>

<p>20. But it is strange in what sense it can be said that
"baptism and the Church cannot in any way be separated and
detached from one another."<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> For if baptism remains inseparably
in him who is baptized, how can it be that he can be
separated from the Church, and baptism cannot? But it is
clear that baptism does remain inseparably in the baptized
person; because into whatever depth of evil, and into whatever
fearful whirlpool of sin the baptized person may fall, even
to the ruin of apostasy, he yet is not bereft of his baptism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
And therefore, if through repentance he returns, it is not given
again, because it is judged that he could not have been without
it even in his sin. But who can ever doubt that a
baptized person can be separated from the Church? For
hence all the heresies have proceeded which deceive by the
use of Christian terms.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xvi.</span>&mdash;Wherefore, since it is manifest that the baptism
remains in the baptized person when he is separated from
the Church, the baptism which is in him is certainly separated
with him. And therefore not all who retain the baptism
retain the Church, just as not all who retain the Church
retain eternal life. Or if we say that only those retain the
Church who observe the commandments of God, we at once
concede that there are many who retain baptism, and do not
retain the Church.</p>

<p>21. Therefore the heretic is not "the first to seize baptism,"
since he has received it from the Church. Nor, though
he seceded, could baptism have been lost by him whom we
assert no longer to retain the Church, and yet allow to retain
baptism. Nor does any one "yield his birthright, and give
it to a heretic," because he says that he took away with
him what he could not give lawfully, but what would yet be
according to law when given; or that he no longer has lawfully
what yet is in accordance with law in his possession.
But the birthright rests only in a holy conversation and good
life, to which all belong of whom that bride consists as her
members which has no spot or wrinkle,<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> or that dove that
groans amid the wickedness of the many crows,&mdash;unless it be
that, while Esau lost his birthright from his lust after a mess
of pottage,<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> we are yet to hold that it is retained by defrauders,
robbers, usurers, envious persons, drunkards, and the like, over
whose existence in the Church of his time Cyprian groaned in
his epistles. Wherefore, either it is not the same thing to
retain the Church and to retain the birthright in divine
things, or, if every one who retains the Church also retains
the birthright, then all those wicked ones do not retain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Church who yet both seem and are allowed by every one of
us to give baptism within the Church; for no one, save the
man who is wholly ignorant of sacred things, would say that
they retain the birthright in sacred things.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xvii.</span>&mdash;22. But, having considered and handled all
these points, we have now come to that peaceful utterance of
Cyprian at the end of the epistle, with which I am never
sated, though I read and re-read it again and again,&mdash;so great
is the pleasantness of brotherly love which breathes forth
from it, so great the sweetness of charity in which it abounds.
"These things," he says, "we have written unto you, dearest
brother, shortly, according to our poor ability, prescribing to or
prejudging no one, lest each bishop should not do what he
thinks right, in the free exercise of his own will. We, so far
as in us lies, do not contend on the subject of heretics with
our colleagues and fellow-bishops, with whom we maintain
concord and peace in the Lord; especially as the apostle also
says, 'If any man seem to be contentious, we have no such
custom, neither the churches of God.'<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> We observe patiently
and gently charity of spirit, the honour of our brotherhood,
the bond of faith, the harmony of the priesthood. For this
reason also, to the best of our poor ability, by the permission
and the inspiration of God we have written this treatise on
'The Good of Patience,' which we have sent to you in consideration
of our mutual love."<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>23. There are many things to be considered in these words,
wherein the brightness of Christian charity shines forth in
this man, who "loved the beauty of the Lord's house, and the
place of the tabernacle of His habitation."<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> First, that he did
not conceal what he felt; then, that he set it forth so gently
and peacefully, in that he maintained the peace of the Church
with those who thought otherwise, because he understood how
great healthfulness was bound up in the bond of peace, loving
it so much, and maintaining it with sobriety, seeing and feeling
that even men who think differently may entertain their several
sentiments without breach of Christian charity. For he would
not say that he could maintain divine concord or the peace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the Lord with evil men; for the good man can observe peace
towards wicked men, but he cannot be united with them in
the peace which they have not. Lastly, that prescribing to no
one, and prejudging no one, lest each bishop should not do
what he thinks right in the free exercise of his own will, he
has left for us also, whatsoever we may be, a place for treating
peacefully of those things with him. For he is present, not
only in his letters, but by that very charity which existed in
so extraordinary a degree in him, and which can never die.
Longing, therefore, with the aid of his prayers, to cling to and
be in union with him, if I be not hindered by the unmeetness
of my sins, I will learn if I can through his letters with
how great peace and comfort the Lord administered His Church
through him; and, putting on the bowels of humility through
the moving influence of his discourse, if, in common with the
Church at large, I entertain any doctrine more true than
his, I will not prefer my heart to his, even in the point in
which he, though holding different views, was yet not severed
from the Church throughout the world. For in that, when that
question was yet undecided for want of full discussion, though
his sentiments differed from those of many of his colleagues,
yet he observed so great moderation, that he would not mutilate
the sacred fellowship of the Church of God by any stain
of schism, a greater strength of excellence appeared in him
than would have been shown if, without that virtue, he had
held views on every point not only true, but coinciding with
their own. Nor should I be acting as he would wish, if I
were to pretend to prefer his talent and his fluency of discourse
and copiousness of learning to the holy Council of all nations,
whereat he was assuredly present through the unity of his
spirit, especially as he is now placed in such full light of truth
as to see with perfect certainty what he was here seeking in
the spirit of perfect peace. For out of that rich abundance
he smiles at all that here seems eloquence in us, as though it
were the first essay of infancy; there he sees by what rule of
piety he acted here, that nothing should be dearer in the
Church to him than unity. There, too, with unspeakable delight
he beholds with what prescient and most merciful providence
the Lord, that He might heal our swellings, "chose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
the foolish things of the world to confound the wise,"<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> and, in
the ordering of the members of His Church, placed all things
in such healthful wise, that men should not say that they were
chosen to the help of the gospel for their own talent or learning,
of whose source they yet were ignorant, and so be puffed up
with deadly pride. Oh, how Cyprian rejoices! With how
much more perfect calmness does he behold how greatly it
conduces to the health of the human race, that in the writings
even of Christian and pious orators there should be found
what merits blame, and in the writings of the fishermen there
should nothing of the sort be found! And so I, being fully
assured of this joy of that holy soul, neither in any way venture
to think or say that my writings are free from every kind
of error, nor, in opposing that opinion of his, wherein it
seemed to him that those who came from among heretics were
to be received otherwise than either they had been in former
days, as he himself bears witness, or are now received, as is
the reasonable custom, confirmed by a general Council of the
whole Christian world, do I set against him my own view,
but that of the holy Catholic Church, which he so loved and
loves, in which he brought forth such abundant fruit with
tolerance, whose entirety he himself was not, but in whose
unity he remained; whose root he never left, but, though he
already brought forth fruit from its root, he was purged by
the heavenly Husbandman that he should bring forth more
fruit;<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> for whose peace and safety, that the wheat might not be
rooted out together with the tares, he both reproved with the
freedom of truth, and endured with the grace of charity, so
many evils on the part of men who were placed in unity with
himself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xviii.</span>&mdash;24. Whence Cyprian himself<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> again admonishes
us with the greatest fulness, that many who were dead in their
trespasses and sins, although they did not belong to the body
of Christ, and the members of that innocent and guileless dove
(so that if she alone baptized, they certainly could not baptize),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
yet to all appearance seemed both to be baptized and to baptize
within the Church. Since, therefore, there be dead men within
the Church, who either do not belong at all to that living dove,
or at least do not as yet belong to her; and since there be
dead men without, who yet more clearly do not belong to her
at all, or not as yet; and since it is true that "another man
cannot be quickened by one who himself liveth not,"&mdash;it is
therefore clear that those who within are baptized by such
persons, if they approach the sacrament with true conversion
of heart, are quickened by Him whose baptism it is. But
if they renounce the world in word and not in deed, as
Cyprian declares to be the case with some who are within, it
is then manifest that they are not themselves quickened unless
they be converted, and yet that they have true baptism even
though they be not converted. Whence also it is likewise
clear that those who are dead without, although they neither
"live themselves, nor quicken others," yet have the living
baptism, which would profit them unto life so soon as they
should be converted unto peace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xix.</span>&mdash;25. Wherefore, as regards those who received
the persons who came from heresy in the same baptism of
Christ with which they had been baptized outside the Church,
and said "that they followed ancient custom," it is in vain
urged against them "that among the ancients heresies and
schisms were yet in their very infancy,<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> so that those were
involved in them who were seceders from the Church, and had
originally been baptized within the Church, so that it was not
necessary that they should be baptized again when they returned
and did penance." For so soon as each several heresy
existed, and departed from the communion of the Catholic
Church, it was possible that, I will not even say the next day,
but even on that very day, its votaries might have baptized
some who flocked to them. And therefore if this was the old
custom, that they should be so received into the Church (as
could not be denied even by those who maintained the contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
part in the discussion), there can be no doubt in the mind of
any one who pays careful attention to the matter, that those also
were so received who had been baptized without in heresy.</p>

<p>26. But I cannot see what show of reason there is in this,
that the name of "erring sheep" should be denied to one whose
lot it has been that, while seeking the salvation which is in
Christ, he has fallen into the error of heretics, and been baptized
in their body; while he is held to have become a sheep
already within the body of the Catholic Church herself, who
has renounced the world in words and not in deeds, and has
received baptism in such falseness of heart as this. Or if such
an one also does not become a sheep unless after turning to
God with a true heart, then, as he is not baptized at the time
when he becomes a sheep, if he had been already baptized, but
was not yet a sheep; so he too, who comes from the heretics
that he may become a sheep, is not then to be baptized if he
had been already baptized with the same baptism, though he
was not yet a sheep. Wherefore, since even all the bad that
are within&mdash;the covetous, the envious, the drunkards, and those
that live contrary to the discipline of Christ&mdash;may be deservedly
called liars, and in darkness, and dead, and antichrists,
do they yet therefore not baptize, on the ground that
"there can be nothing common between truth and falsehood,
between light and darkness, between death and immortality,
between Antichrist and Christ?"</p>

<p>27. He makes an assumption, then, not "of mere custom,"
but "of the reason of truth itself," when he says that the
sacrament of God cannot be turned to error by the error of
any men, since it is declared to exist even in those who have
erred. Assuredly the Apostle John says most plainly, "He
that hateth his brother is in darkness even until now;"<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> and
again, "Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer;"<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> and
why, therefore, do they baptize within the Church whom
Cyprian himself declares to be in the envy of malice?<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xx.</span> How does a murderer cleanse and sanctify the
water?<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> How can darkness bless the oil? But if God is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
present in His sacraments to confirm His words by whomsoever
the sacraments may be administered, then both the
sacraments of God are everywhere valid, and evil men whom
they profit not are everywhere perverse.</p>

<p>28. But what kind of argument is this, that "a heretic
must be considered not to have baptism, because he has not
the Church?" And it must be acknowledged that "when
he is baptized, he is questioned about the Church."<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Just as
though the same question about the Church were not put in
baptism to him who within the Church renounces the world
in word and not in deed. As therefore his false answer does
not prevent what he receives from being baptism, so also the
false reply of the other about the holy Church does not prevent
what he receives from being baptism; and as the former,
if he afterwards fulfil with truth what he promised in falsehood,
does not receive a second baptism, but only an amended
life, so also in the case of the latter, if he come afterwards to
the Church about which he gave a false answer to the question
put to him, thinking that he had it when he had it not,
the Church herself which he did not possess is given him,
but what he had received is not repeated. But I cannot tell
why it should be, that while God can "sanctify the oil" in
answer to the words which proceed out of the mouth of a
murderer, He yet cannot sanctify it on the altar reared by a
heretic, unless it be that He who is not hindered by the false
conversion of the heart of man within the Church is hindered
by the false erection of some wood without from deigning to
be present in His sacraments, though no falseness on the part of
men can hinder Him. If, therefore, what is said in the gospel,
that "God heareth not sinners,"<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> extends so far that the sacraments
cannot be celebrated by a sinner, how then does He
hear a murderer praying, either over the water of baptism, or
over the oil, or over the eucharist, or over the heads of those
on whom his hand is laid? All which things are neverthe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>less
done, and are valid, even at the hands of murderers, that
is, at the hands of those who hate their brethren, even within,
in the Church itself. Since "no one can give what he does
not possess himself," how does a murderer give the Holy
Spirit? And yet such an one even baptizeth within the
Church. It is God, therefore, that gives the Holy Spirit
even when a man of this kind is baptizing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxi.</span>&mdash;29. But as to what he says, that "he who
comes to the Church is to be baptized and renewed, that
within he may be hallowed through the holy," what will he
do, if within also he meets with those who are not holy?
Or can it be that the murderer is holy? And if the reason for
his being baptized in the Church is that "he should put off
this very thing also that he, being a man that sought to come
to God, fell, through the deceit of error, on one profane," where
is he afterwards to put off this, that he may chance, while
seeking a man of God within the Church itself, to have fallen,
through the deceit of error, on a murderer? If "there cannot
be in a man something that is void and something that is
valid," why is it possible that in a murderer the sacrament
should be holy and his heart unholy? If "whosoever cannot
give the Holy Spirit cannot baptize," why does the murderer
baptize within the Church? Or how has the murderer the
Holy Spirit, when every one that has the Holy Spirit is filled
with light, but "he who hates his brother is still in darkness?"
If because "there is one baptism, and one Spirit," therefore they
cannot have the one baptism who have not the one Spirit, why
do the innocent man and the murderer within the Church have
the one baptism and not have the one Spirit? So therefore
the heretic and the Catholic may have the one baptism, and
yet not have the one Church, as in the Catholic Church the
innocent man and the murderer may have the one baptism,
though they have not the one Spirit; for as there is one
baptism, so there is one Spirit and one Church. And so the
result is, that in each person we must acknowledge what he
already has, and to each person we must give what he has
not. If "nothing can be confirmed and ratified with God
which has been done by those whom God calls His enemies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
and foes," why is the baptism confirmed which is given by
murderers? Are we not to call murderers the enemies and
foes of the Lord? But "he that hateth his brother is a
murderer." How then did they baptize who hated Paul, the
servant of Jesus Christ, and thereby hated Jesus Himself,
since He Himself said to Saul, "Why persecutest thou me?"<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
when he was persecuting His servants, and since at the last
He Himself shall say, "Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of
the least of these that are mine, ye did it not to me?"<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
Wherefore all who go out from us are not of us, but not all
who are with us are of us; just as when men thresh, all that
flies from the threshing-floor is shown not to be corn, but not
all that remains there is therefore corn. And so John too
says, "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for
if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued
with us."<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> Wherefore God gives the sacrament of grace even
through the hands of wicked men, but the grace itself only
by Himself or through His saints. And therefore He gives
remission of sins either of Himself, or through the members
of that dove to whom He says, "Whose soever sins ye remit,
they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain,
they are retained."<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> But since no one can doubt that baptism,
which is the sacrament of the remission of sins, is possessed
even by murderers, who are yet in darkness because the hatred
of their brethren is not excluded from their hearts, therefore
either no remission of sins is given to them if their baptism
is accompanied by no change of heart for the better, or if the
sins are remitted, they at once return on them again. And
we learn that the baptism is holy in itself, because it is of
God; and whether it be given or whether it be received by
men of such like character, it cannot be polluted by any perversity
of theirs, either within, or yet outside the Church.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxii.</span>&mdash;30. Accordingly we agree with Cyprian that
heretics cannot give remission of sins; but we maintain that
they can give baptism,&mdash;which indeed in them, both when
they give and when they receive it, is profitable only to their
destruction, as misusing so great a gift of God; just as also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the malicious and envious, whom Cyprian himself acknowledges
to be within the Church, cannot give remission of sins,
while we all confess that they can give baptism. For if it
was said of those who have sinned against us, "If ye forgive
not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your
trespasses,"<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> how much more impossible is it that their sins
should be forgiven who hate the brethren by whom they are
loved, and are baptized in that very hatred; and yet when
they are brought to the right way, baptism is not given them
anew, but that very pardon which they did not then deserve
is granted them in their true conversion? And so even what
Cyprian wrote to Quintus, and what, in conjunction with his
colleagues Liberalis, Caldonius, Junius, and the rest, he wrote
to Saturninus, Maximus, and others, is all found, on due consideration,
to be in no wise meet to be preferred as against
the agreement of the whole Catholic Church, of which they
rejoiced that they were members, and from which they neither
cut themselves away nor allowed others to be cut away who
held a contrary opinion, until at length, by the will of the
Lord, it was made manifest, by a general Council many
years afterwards, what was the more perfect way, and that
not by the institution of any novelty, but by confirming
what was old.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxiii.</span>&mdash;31. Cyprian writes also to Pompeius<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> about
this selfsame matter, and clearly shows in that letter that
Stephen, who, as we learn, was then bishop of the Roman
Church, not only did not agree with him upon the points
before us, but even wrote and taught the opposite views.
But Stephen certainly did not "communicate with heretics,"
merely because he did not dare to impugn the baptism of
Christ, which he knew remained perfect in the midst of their
perversity. For if none have baptism who entertain false
views about God, it has been proved sufficiently, in my
opinion, that this may happen even within the Church. "The
apostles," indeed, "gave no injunctions on the point;" but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
custom, which is opposed to Cyprian, may be supposed to
have had its origin in apostolic tradition, just as there are
many things which are observed by the whole Church, and
therefore are fairly held to have been enjoined by the apostles,
which yet are not mentioned in their writings.</p>

<p>32. But it will be urged that it is written of heretics that
"they are condemned of themselves."<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> What then? are they
not also condemned of themselves to whom it was said, "For
wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself?"<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
But to these the apostle says, "Thou that preachest a man
should not steal, dost thou steal?"<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> and so forth. And
such truly were they who, being bishops and established in
Catholic unity with Cyprian himself, used to plunder estates
by treacherous frauds, preaching all the time to the people
the words of the apostle, who says, "Nor shall extortioners
inherit the kingdom of God."<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>33. Wherefore I will do no more than run shortly through
the other sentiments founded on the same rules, which are in
the aforesaid letter written to Pompeius. By what authority
of holy Scripture is it shown that it is against the commandment
of God that persons coming from the society of
heretics, if they have already there received the baptism of
Christ, are not baptized again? But it is clearly shown that
many pretended Christians, though they are not joined in the
same bond of charity with the saints, without which anything
holy that they may have been able to possess is of no profit
to them, yet have baptism in common with the saints, as has
been already sufficiently proved with the greatest fulness.
He says "that the Church, and the Spirit, and baptism, are
mutually incapable of separation from each other, and therefore"
he wishes that "those who are separated from the
Church and the Holy Spirit should be understood to be
separated also from baptism." But if this is the case, then
when any one has received baptism in the Catholic Church,
it remains so long in him as he himself remains in the
Church, which is not so. For it is not restored to him
when he returns, just because he did not lose it when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
seceded. But as the disaffected sons have not the Holy
Spirit in the same manner as the beloved sons, and yet
they have baptism; so heretics also have not the Church
as Catholics have, and yet they have baptism. "For the
Holy Spirit of discipline will flee deceit,"<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> and yet baptism
will not flee from it. And so, as baptism can continue in
one from whom the Holy Spirit withdraws Himself, so can
baptism continue where the Church is not. But if "the laying
on of hands" were not applied to one coming from heresy,
he would be as it were judged to be wholly blameless; but
for the uniting of love, which is the greatest gift of the Holy
Spirit, without which any other holy thing that there may
be in a man is profitless to his salvation, hands are laid
on heretics when they are brought to a knowledge of the
truth.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxiv.</span>&mdash;34. I remember that I have already discussed
at sufficient length the question of "the temple of
God," and how this saying is to be taken, "As many of you
as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ."<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> For
neither are the covetous the temple of God, since it is written,
"What agreement hath the temple of God with idols?"<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> And
Cyprian has adduced the testimony of Paul to the fact that
covetousness is idolatry. But men put on Christ, sometimes
so far as to receive the sacrament, sometimes so much further
as to receive holiness of life. And the first of these is common
to good and bad alike; the second, peculiar to the good and
pious. Wherefore, if "baptism cannot be without the Spirit,"
then heretics have the Spirit also,&mdash;but to destruction, not to
salvation, just as was the case with Saul.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> For in the Holy
Spirit devils are cast out through the name of Christ, which
even he was able to do who was without the Church, which
called forth a suggestion from the disciples to their Lord.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
Just as the covetous have the Holy Spirit, who yet are not
the temple of God. For "what agreement hath the temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of God with idols?" If therefore the covetous have not the
Spirit of God, and yet have baptism, it is possible for baptism
to exist without the Spirit of God.</p>

<p>35. If heresy is rendered "unable to engender sons to God
through Christ, because it is not the bride of Christ," neither
can that crowd of evil men established within the Church,
since it is also not the bride of Christ; for the bride of
Christ is described as being without spot or wrinkle.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> Therefore
either not all baptized persons are the sons of God, or
even that which is not the bride can engender the sons of
God. But as it is asked whether "he is spiritually born who
has received the baptism of Christ in the midst of heretics,"
so it may be asked whether he is spiritually born who has
received the baptism of Christ in the Catholic Church,
without being turned to God in a true heart, of whom it
cannot be said that he has not received baptism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxv.</span>&mdash;36. I am unwilling to go on to handle again
what Cyprian poured forth with signs of irritation against
Stephen, as it is, moreover, quite unnecessary. For they are
but the selfsame arguments which have already been sufficiently
discussed; and it is better to pass over those points
which involved the danger of baneful dissension. But
Stephen thought that we should even hold aloof from those
who endeavoured to destroy the primitive custom in the
matter of receiving heretics; whereas Cyprian, moved by
the difficulty of the question itself, and being most largely
endowed with the holy bowels of Christian charity, thought
that we ought to remain at unity with those who differed
in opinion from ourselves. Therefore, although he was not
without excitement, though of a truly brotherly kind, in his
indignation, yet the peace of Christ prevailed in their hearts,
that in such a dispute no evil of schism should arise between
them. But it was not found that "hence grew more abundant
heresies and schisms," because what is of Christ in them
is approved, and what is of themselves is condemned; for
all the more those who hold this law of rebaptizing were cut
into smaller fragments.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxvi.</span>&mdash;37. To go on to what he says, "that a
bishop should be 'teachable,'"<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> adding, "But he is teachable
who is gentle and meek to learn; for a bishop ought not only
to teach, but to learn as well, since he is indeed the better
teacher who daily grows and advances by learning better
things;"&mdash;in these words assuredly the holy man, endowed
with pious charity, sufficiently points out that we should not
hesitate to read his letters in such a sense, that we should
feel no difficulty if the Church should afterwards confirm what
had been discovered by further and longer discussions; because,
as there were many things which the learned Cyprian
might teach, so there was still something which the teachable
Cyprian might learn. But the admonition that he gives us,
"that we should go back to the fountain, that is, to apostolic
tradition, and thence turn the channel of truth to our
times," is most excellent, and should be followed without
hesitation. It is handed down to us, therefore, as he himself
records, by the apostles, that there is "one God, and one
Christ, and one hope, and one faith, and one Church, and
one baptism."<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Since then we find that in the times of the
apostles themselves there were some who had not the one
hope, but had the one baptism, the truth is so brought down
to us from the fountain itself, that it is clear to us that it is
possible that though there is one Church, as there is one
hope, and one baptism, they may yet have the one baptism
who have not the one Church; just as even in those early
times it was possible that men should have the one baptism
who had not the one hope. For how had they one hope with
the holy and the just, who used to say, "Let us eat and
drink, for to-morrow we die,"<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> asserting that there was no
resurrection of the dead? And yet they were among the very
men to whom the same apostle says, "Was Paul crucified for
you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?"<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> For he
writes most manifestly to them, saying, "How say some
among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?"<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxvii.</span>&mdash;38. And in that the Church is thus described
in the Song of Songs, "A garden enclosed is my sister, my
spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed: thy plants are
an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits;"<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> I dare not
understand this save of the holy and just,&mdash;not of the covetous,
and defrauders, and robbers, and usurers, and drunkards, and
the envious, of whom we yet both learn most fully from
Cyprian's letters, as I have often shown, and teach ourselves,
that they had baptism in common with the just, in common
with whom they certainly had not Christian charity. For I
would that some one would tell me how they "crept into the
garden enclosed and the fountain sealed," of whom Cyprian
bears witness that they renounced the world in word and not
in deed, and that yet they were within the Church. For if
they both are themselves there, and are themselves the bride
of Christ, can she then be as she is described, "without spot or
wrinkle,"<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> and is the fair dove defiled with such a portion of
her members? Are these the thorns among which she is a
lily, as it is said in the same Song?<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> So far, therefore, as the
lily extends, so far does "the garden enclosed and the fountain
sealed," namely, through all those just persons who are Jews
inwardly in the circumcision of the heart<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> (for "the king's
daughter is all glorious within"<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>), in whom is the fixed number
of the saints predestined before the foundation of the world.
But that multitude of thorns, whether in secret or in open
separation, is pressing on it from without, over and above the
number. "If I would declare them," it is said, "and speak of
them, they are more than can be numbered."<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> The number,
therefore, of the just persons, "who are the called according
to His purpose,"<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> of whom it is said, "The Lord knoweth
them that are His,"<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> is itself "the garden enclosed, the fountain
sealed, the orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits."
Of this number some live according to the Spirit, and enter
on the excellent way of charity; and when they "restore a
man that is overtaken in a fault in the spirit of meekness,
they consider themselves, lest they also be tempted."<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
when it happens that they also are themselves overtaken, the
affection of charity is but a little checked, and not extinguished;
and again rising up and being kindled afresh, it is
restored to its former course. For they know how to say,
"My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according
unto Thy word."<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> But when "in anything they be otherwise
minded, God shall reveal even this unto them,"<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> if they
abide in the burning flame of charity, and do not break the
bond of peace. But some who are yet carnal, and full of
fleshly appetites, are instant in working out their progress;
and that they may become fit for heavenly food, they are
nourished with the milk of the holy mysteries, they avoid in the
fear of God whatever is manifestly corrupt even in the opinion
of the world, and they strive most watchfully that they may
be less and less delighted with worldly and temporal matters.
They observe most constantly the rule of faith which has
been sought out with diligence; and if in ought they stray
from it, they submit to speedy correction under Catholic
authority, although, in Cyprian's words, they be tossed about,
by reason of their fleshly appetite, with the various conflicts
of phantasies. There are some also who as yet live wickedly,
or even lie in heresies or the superstitions of the Gentiles, and
yet even then "the Lord knoweth them that are His." For,
in that unspeakable foreknowledge of God, many who seem to
be without are in reality within, and many who seem to be
within yet really are without. Of all those, therefore, who, if
I may so say, are inwardly and secretly within, is that "enclosed
garden" composed, "the fountain sealed, the orchard of
pomegranates, with pleasant fruits." The divinely imparted
gifts of these are partly peculiar to themselves, as in this
world the charity that never faileth, and in the world to
come eternal life; partly they are common with evil and perverse
men, as all the other things in which consist the holy
mysteries.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxviii.</span>&mdash;39. Hence, therefore, we have now set before
us an easier and more simple consideration of that ark of which
Noah was the builder and pilot. For Peter says that in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
ark of Noah, "few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.
The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save
us, (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the
answer of a good conscience towards God)."<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Wherefore, if
those appear to men to be baptized in Catholic unity who
renounce the world in words only and not in deeds, how do
they belong to the mystery of this ark in whom there is not
the answer of a good conscience? Or how are they saved
by water, who, making a bad use of holy baptism, though they
seem to be within, yet persevere to the end of their days in a
wicked and abandoned course of life? Or how can they fail
to be saved by water, of whom Cyprian himself records that
they were in time past simply admitted to the Church with
the baptism which they had received in heresy? For the
same unity of the ark saved them, in which no one has been
saved except by water. For Cyprian himself says, "The Lord
is able of His mercy to grant pardon, and not to sever from
the gifts of His Church those who, being in all simplicity
admitted to the Church, have fallen asleep within her pale."<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
If not by water, how in the ark? If not in the ark, how in
the Church? But if in the Church, certainly in the ark; and
if in the ark, certainly by water. It is therefore possible
that some who have been baptized without may be considered,
through the foreknowledge of God, to have been really baptized
within, because within the water begins to be profitable
to them unto salvation; nor can they be said to have been
otherwise saved in the ark except by water. And again, some
who seemed to have been baptized within may be considered,
through the same foreknowledge of God, more truly to have
been baptized without, since, by making a bad use of baptism,
they die by water, which then happened to no one who was
not outside the ark. Certainly it is clear that, when we speak
of within and without in relation to the Church, it is the
position of the heart that we must consider, not that of the
body, since all who are within in heart are saved in the
unity of the ark through the same water, through which all
who are in heart without, whether they are also in body without
or not, die as enemies of unity. As therefore it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
another but the same water that saved those who were placed
within the ark, and destroyed those who were left without the
ark, so it is not by different baptisms, but by the same, that
good Catholics are saved, and bad Catholics or heretics perish.
But what the most blessed Cyprian thinks of the Catholic
Church, and how the heretics are utterly crushed by his
authority, notwithstanding the much I have already said, I
have yet determined to set forth by itself, if God will, with
somewhat greater fulness and perspicuity, so soon as I shall
have first said about his Council what I think is due from
me, which, in God's will, I shall attempt in the following
book.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><small>IN WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE COUNCIL OF CARTHAGE, HELD UNDER THE
AUTHORITY AND PRESIDENCY OF CYPRIAN, TO DETERMINE THE QUESTION
OF THE BAPTISM OF HERETICS.</small></p></blockquote>


<p class="cap">CHAP. I.&mdash;1. It might perhaps have been sufficient,
that after the reasons have been so often repeated,
and considered, and discussed with such variety of treatment,
supplemented, too, with the addition of proofs from holy
Scripture, and the concurrent testimony of so many passages
from Cyprian himself, even those who are slow of heart
should thus understand, as I believe they do, that the
baptism of Christ cannot be rendered void by any perversity
on the part of man, whether in administering or receiving it.
And when we find that in those times, when the point in
question was decided in a manner contrary to ancient custom,
after discussions carried on without violation of Christian
charity and unity, it appeared to certain eminent men even
amongst the servants of Christ, among whom the blessed
Cyprian was specially conspicuous, that the baptism of Christ
could not exist among heretics or schismatics, this simply
arose from their not distinguishing the sacrament from the
effect or use of the sacrament; and because its effect and
use was not found among heretics in freeing them from their
sins and setting their hearts right, the sacrament itself was
also thought to be wanting among them. But if we turn our
eyes to the multitude of chaff within the Church, since these
also who are perverse and lead an abandoned life in unity
itself appear to have no power either of giving or retaining
remission of sins, seeing that it is not to the wicked but the
good sons that it was said, "Whose soever sins ye remit, they
are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
they are retained,"<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> yet that such persons both have, and
give, and receive the sacrament of baptism, was sufficiently
manifest to the pastors of the Catholic Church dispersed over
the whole world, through whom the original custom was
afterwards confirmed by the authority of a general Council;
so that even the sheep which was straying outside, and had
received the mark of the Lord from false plunderers outside,
if it seek the salvation of Christian unity, is purified from
error, is freed from captivity, is healed of its wound, and yet
the mark of the Lord is recognised rather than rejected in it;
since the mark itself is often impressed both by wolves and
on wolves, who seem indeed to be within the fold, but yet
are proved by the fruits of their conduct, in which they persevere
even to the end, not to belong to that sheep which is
one in many; because, according to the foreknowledge of
God, as many sheep wander outside, so many wolves lurk
treacherously within, among whom the Lord yet knoweth
them that are His, which hear only the voice of the Shepherd,
even when He calls by the voice of men like the Pharisees,
of whom it was said, "Whatsoever they bid you observe, that
observe and do."<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>2. For as the spiritual man, keeping "the end of the commandment,"
that is, "charity out of a pure heart, and of a good
conscience, and of faith unfeigned,"<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> can see some things less
clearly out of a body which is yet "corruptible and presseth
down the soul,"<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> and is liable to be otherwise minded in
some things which God will reveal<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> to him in His own good
time if he abide in the same charity, so in a carnal and perverse
man something good and useful may be found, which has its
origin not in the man himself, but in some other source. For
as in the fruitful branch there is found something which must
be purged that it may bring forth more fruit, so also a grape
is often found to hang on a cane that is barren and dry or
fettered. And so, as it is foolish to love the portions which
require purging in the fruitful branch, whilst he acts wisely
who does not reject the sweet fruit wherever it may hang, so,
if any one cuts himself off from unity by rebaptizing, simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
because it seemed to Cyprian that one ought to baptize again
those who came from the heretics, such a man turns aside
from what merits praise in that great man, and follows what
requires correction, and does not even attain to the very thing
he follows after. For Cyprian, while grievously abhorring, in
his zeal for God, all those who severed themselves from unity,
thought that thereby they were separated from baptism itself;
while these men, thinking it at most a slight offence that
they themselves are severed from the unity of Christ, even
maintain that His baptism is not in that unity, but issued
forth with them. Therefore they are so far from the fruitfulness
of Cyprian, as not even to be equal to the parts in
him which needed purging.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ii.</span>&mdash;3. Again, if any one not having charity, and
walking in the abandoned paths of a most wicked life, seems
to be within whilst he really is without, and at the same time
does not seek for the repetition of baptism even in the case
of heretics, it in no wise helps his barrenness, because he is
not rendered fruitful with his own fruit, but laden with that
of others. But it is possible that some one may flourish in
the root of charity, and may be most rightly minded in the
point in which Cyprian was otherwise minded, and yet there
may be more that is fruitful in Cyprian than in him, more
that requires purging in him than in Cyprian. Not only,
therefore, do we not compare bad Catholics with the blessed
Cyprian, but even good Catholics we do not hastily pronounce
to be on an equality with him whom our pious mother Church
counts among the few rare men of surpassing excellence and
grace, although these others may recognise the baptism of
Christ even among heretics, whilst he thought otherwise; so
that, by the instance of Cyprian, who saw one point less
clearly, and yet remained most firm in the unity of the
Church, it might be shown more clearly to heretics what a
sacrilegious crime it was to break the bond of peace. For
neither were the blind Pharisees, although they sometimes
enjoined what was right to be done, to be compared to the
Apostle Peter, though he at times enjoined what was not
right. But not only is their dryness not to be compared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
his greenness, but even the fruit of others may not be deemed
equal to his fertility. For no one now compels the Gentiles to
Judaize, and yet no one now in the Church, however great his
progress in goodness, may be compared with the apostleship
of Peter. Wherefore, while rendering due reverence, and
paying, so far as I can, the fitting honour to the peaceful
bishop and glorious martyr Cyprian, I yet venture to say that
his view concerning the baptism of schismatics and heretics
was contrary to that which was afterwards brought to light
by a decision, not of mine, but of the whole Church, confirmed
and strengthened by the authority of a general
Council: just as, while paying the reverence he deserves to
Peter, the first of the apostles and most eminent of martyrs,
I yet venture to say that he did not do right in compelling
the Gentiles to Judaize; for this also I say, not of my own
teaching, but according to the wholesome doctrine of the
Apostle Paul, retained and preserved throughout the whole
Church.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>4. Therefore, in discussing the opinion of Cyprian, though
myself of far inferior merit to Cyprian, I say that good and
bad alike can have, can give, can receive the sacrament of
baptism,&mdash;the good, indeed, to their health and profit; the bad
to their destruction and ruin,&mdash;whilst the sacrament itself is
of equal perfectness in both of them; and that it is of no
consequence to its equal perfectness in all, how much worse
the man may be that has it among the bad, just as it makes
no difference how much better he may be that has it among
the good. And accordingly it makes no difference either how
much worse he may be that confers it, as it makes no difference
how much better he may be; and so it makes no difference
how much worse he may be that receives it, as it makes
no difference how much better he may be. For the sacrament
is equally holy, in virtue of its own excellence, both in
those who are unequally just, and in those who are unequally
unjust.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. iii.</span>&mdash;5. But I think that we have sufficiently shown,
both from the canon of Scripture, and from the letters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Cyprian himself, that bad men, while by no means converted
to a better mind, can have, and confer, and receive baptism,
of whom it is most clear that they do not belong to the holy
Church of God, though they seem to be within it, inasmuch as
they are covetous, robbers, usurers, envious, evil thinkers, and
the like; whilst she is one dove,<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> modest and chaste, a bride

properties which are attributed to her; and all this can only
be understood to be in the good, and holy, and just,&mdash;following,
that is, not only the operations of the gifts of God, which are
common to good and bad alike, but also the inner bond of
charity conspicuous in those who have the Holy Spirit, to
whom the Lord says, "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are
remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. iv.</span>&mdash;6. And so it is clear that no good ground is
shown herein why the bad man, who has baptism, may not
also confer it; and as he has it to destruction, so he may also
confer it to destruction,&mdash;not because this is the character of
the thing conferred, nor of the person conferring, but because
it is the character of him on whom it is conferred. For when
a bad man confers it on a good man, that is, on one in the
bond of unity, converted with a true conversion, the wickedness
of him who confers it makes no severance between the
good sacrament which is conferred, and the good member of
the Church on whom it is conferred. And when his sins are
forgiven him on his true conversion to God, they are forgiven
by those to whom he is united by his true conversion. For
the same Spirit forgives them, which is given to all the saints
that cling to one another in love, whether they know one
another in the body or not. Similarly when a man's sins are
retained, they are assuredly retained by those from whom he,
in whom they are retained, separates himself by dissimilarity
of life, and by the turning away of a corrupt heart, whether
they know him in the body or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. v.</span>&mdash;7. Wherefore all bad men are separated in the
spirit from the good; but if they are separated in the body
also by a manifest dissension, they are made yet worse. But,
as it has been said, it makes no difference to the holiness of
baptism how much worse the man may be that has it, or how
much worse he that confers it: yet he that is separated may
confer it, as he that is separated may have it; but as he has
it to destruction, so he may confer it to destruction. But he
on whom he confers it may receive it to his soul's health, if
he, on his part, receive it not in separation; as it has happened
to many that, in a catholic spirit, and with heart not
alienated from the unity of peace, they have, under some
pressure of impending death, turned hastily to some heretic
and received from him the baptism of Christ without any
share in his perversity, so that, whether dying or restored to
life, they by no means remain in communion with those to
whom they never passed in heart. But if the recipient himself
has received the baptism in separation, he receives it so
much the more to his destruction, in proportion to the greatness
of the good which he has not received well; and it tends
the more to his destruction in his separation, as it would
avail the more to the salvation of one in unity. And so, if,
reforming himself from his perverseness and turning from
his separation, he should come to the Catholic peace, his
sins are remitted through the bond of peace and the same
baptism under which his sins were retained through the
sacrilege of separation, because that is always holy both in
the just and the unjust, which is neither increased by the
righteousness nor diminished by the unrighteousness of any
man.</p>

<p>8. This being the case, what bearing has it on so clear a
truth, that many of his fellow-bishops agreed with Cyprian in
that opinion, and advanced their own several opinions on the
same side, except that his charity towards the unity of Christ
might become more and more conspicuous? For if he had
been the only one to hold that opinion, with no one to agree
with him, he might have been thought, in remaining, to have
shrunk from the sin of schism, because he found no companions
in his error; but when so many agreed with him, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
showed, by remaining in unity with the rest who thought
differently from him, that he preserved the most sacred bond
of universal catholicity, not from any fear of isolation, but
from the love of peace. Wherefore it might indeed seem now
to be superfluous to consider the several opinions of the other
bishops also in that Council; but since those who are slow in
heart think that no answer has been made at all, if to any
passage in any discourse the answer which might be brought
to bear on the spot be given not there but somewhere else,
it is better that by reading much they should be polished into
sharpness, than that by understanding little they should have
room left for complaining that the argument has not been
fairly conducted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. vi.</span>&mdash;9. First, then, let us record for further consideration
the case proposed for decision by Cyprian himself,
with which he initiates the proceedings of the Council, and by
which he shows a peaceful spirit, abounding in the fruitfulness
of Christian charity. "Ye have heard," he says, "most
beloved colleagues, what Jubaianus, our fellow-bishop, has
written to me, consulting my poor ability about the unlawful
and profane baptism of heretics, and what I have written
back to him, expressing to him the same opinion that I have
expressed once and again and often, that heretics coming to
the Church ought to be baptized, and sanctified with the
baptism of the Church. Another letter also of Jubaianus has
been read to you, in which, agreeably to his sincere and religious
devotion, in answer to our epistle, he not only expressed
his assent to it, but also gratefully acknowledged that he had
received instruction. It remains that we should individually
express our opinions on this same subject, judging no one,
and removing no one from the right of communion if he
should entertain a different opinion. For neither does any
one of us set himself up as a bishop of bishops, or by tyrannical
terror force his colleagues to the necessity of obeying,
since every bishop, in the free use of his liberty and power,
has the right of free judgment, and can no more be judged by
another than he can himself judge another. But we are all
awaiting the judgment of our Lord Jesus Christ, who alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
has the power both of preferring us in the government of His
Church, and of judging of our actions."<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. vii.</span>&mdash;10. I have already, I think, argued to the
best of my power, in the preceding books, in the interests of
Catholic unanimity and counsel, in whose unity these continued
as pious members, in reply not only to the letter which
Cyprian wrote to Jubaianus, but also to that which he sent to
Quintus, and that which, in conjunction with certain of his
colleagues, he sent to certain other colleagues, and that which
he sent to Pompeius. Wherefore it seems now to be fitting
to consider also what the others severally thought, and that
with the liberty of which he himself would not deprive us, as
he says, "Judging no one, nor removing any from the right of
communion if he entertain different opinions." And that he
did not say this with the object of arriving at the hidden
thoughts of his colleagues, extracted as it were from their
secret lurking-places, but because he really loved peace and
unity, is very easily to be seen from other passages of the
same sort, where he wrote to individuals as to Jubaianus himself.
"These things," he says, "we have written very shortly
in answer to you, most beloved brother, according to our poor
ability, not preventing any one of the bishops, by our writing
or judgment, from acting as he thinks right, having a free
exercise of his own judgment." And that it might not seem
that any one, because of his entertaining different opinions in
this same free exercise of his judgment, should be driven from
the society of his brethren, he goes on to say, "We, so far as
lies in us, do not strive on behalf of heretics against our colleagues
and fellow-bishops, with whom we maintain godly
unity and the peace of our Lord;" and a little later he says,
"Charity of spirit, respect for our college, the bond of faith,
the harmony of the priesthood, are by us maintained with
patience and gentleness."<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> And so also in the epistle which
he wrote to Magnus, when he was asked whether there was
any difference in the efficacy of baptism by sprinkling or by
immersion, "In this matter," he says, "I am too modest and
diffident to prevent any one by my judgment from thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
as he deems right, and acting as he thinks."<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> By which
discourses he clearly shows that these subjects were being
handled by them at a time when they were not yet received
as decided beyond all question, but were being investigated
with great care as being yet unrevealed. We, therefore,
maintaining on the subject of the identity of all baptisms
what must be acknowledged everywhere to be the custom<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> of
the universal Church, and what is confirmed by the decision
of general Councils, and taking greater confidence also from
the words of Cyprian, which allowed me even then to hold
opinions differing from his own without forfeiting the right of
communion, seeing that greater importance and praise were
attached to unity, such as the blessed Cyprian and his colleagues,
with whom he held that Council, maintained with
those of different opinions, disturbing and overthrowing thereby
the seditious calumnies of heretics and schismatics in the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ, who, speaking by His apostle, says,
"Forbearing one another in love, endeavouring to keep the
unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;"<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> and again, by the
mouth of the same apostle, "If in anything ye be otherwise
minded, God shall reveal even this unto you,"<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>&mdash;we, I say,
propose for consideration and discussion the opinions of the
holy bishops, without violating the bond of unity and peace
with them, in maintaining which we imitate them so far as we
can by the aid of the Lord Himself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. viii.</span>&mdash;11. C√¶cilius of Bilta<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> said: "I know of one
baptism in the one Church, and of none outside the Church.
The one will be where there is true hope and sure faith.
For so it is written, 'One faith, one hope, one baptism.'<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
Not among heretics, where there is no hope and a false faith;
where all things are done by a lie; where one possessed of
a devil exorcises; the question of the sacrament is asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
by one from whose mouth and words proceeds a cancer; the
faithless gives faith; the guilty gives pardon for sins; and
Antichrist baptizes in the name of Christ; one accursed of
God blesses; the dead promises life; the unpeaceful gives
peace; the blasphemer calls on God; the profane administers
the priesthood; the sacrilegious sets up the altar. To all this
is added this further evil, that the servant of the devil dares
to celebrate the eucharist. If this be not so, let those who
stand by them prove that all of it is false concerning heretics.
See the kind of things to which the Church is compelled to
assent, being forced to communicate without baptism or the
remission of sins. This, brethren, we ought to shun and avoid,
separating ourselves from so great a sin, and holding to the
one baptism which is granted to the Church alone."<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>12. To this I answer, that all who even within the Church
profess that they know God, but deny Him in their deeds,
such as are the covetous and envious, and those who, because
they hate their brethren, are pronounced to be murderers, not
on my testimony, but on that of the holy Apostle John,<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>&mdash;all
these are both devoid of hope, because they have a bad conscience;
and are faithless, because they do not do what they have
vowed to God; and liars, because they make false professions;
and possessed of devils, because they give place in their heart to
the devil and his angels; and their words work corruption, since
they corrupt good manners by evil communications; and they
are infidels, because they laugh at the threats which God utters
against such men; and accursed, because they live wickedly;
and antichrists, because their lives are opposed to Christ; and
cursed of God, since holy Scripture everywhere calls down
curses on such men; and dead, because they are without the
life of righteousness; and unpeaceful, because by their contrary
deeds they are at variance with God's behests; and
blasphemous, because by their abandoned acts despite is done
to the name of Christian; and profane, because they are spiritually
shut out from that inner sanctuary of God; and sacrilegious,
because by their evil life they defile the temple of
God within themselves; and servants of the devil, because
they do service to fraud and covetousness, which is idolatry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
That of such a kind are some, nay very many, even within
the Church, is testified both by Paul the apostle and by
Cyprian the bishop. Why, then, do they baptize? Why also
are some, who renounce the world in words and not in deeds,
baptized without being converted from a life like this, and not
rebaptized when they are converted? And as to what he says
with such indignation, "See the kind of things to which the
Church is compelled to assent, being forced to communicate
without baptism or the remission of sins," he could never
have used such expressions had there not been the other
bishops who elsewhere forced men to such things. Whence
also it is shown that at that time those men held the truer
views who did not depart from the primitive custom, which is
since confirmed by the consent of a general Council. But
what does he mean by adding, "This, brethren, we ought to
shun and avoid, separating ourselves from so great a sin?"
For if he means that he is not to do nor to approve of this,
that is another matter; but if he means to condemn and sever
from him those that hold the contrary opinion, he is setting
himself against the earlier words of Cyprian, "Judging no
man, nor depriving any of the right of communion if he differ
from us."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ix.</span>&mdash;13. The elder Felix<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> of Migirpa said: "I think
that every one coming from heresy should be baptized. For
in vain does any one suppose that he has been baptized there,
seeing that there is no baptism save the one true baptism in
the Church; for there is one Lord, and one faith, and one
Church, in which rests the one baptism, and holiness, and the
rest. For the things that are practised without have no power
to work salvation."</p>

<p>14. To what Felix of Migirpa said we answer as follows.
If the one true baptism did not exist except in the Church, it
surely would not exist in those who depart from unity. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
it does exist in them, since they do not receive it when they
return, simply because they had not lost it when they departed.
But as regards his statement, that "the things that are practised
without have no power to work salvation," I agree with
him, and think that it is quite true; for it is one thing that
baptism should not be there, and another that it should have
no power to work salvation. For when men come to the
peace of the Catholic Church, then what was in them before
they joined it, but did not profit them, begins at once to profit
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. x.</span>&mdash;15. To the declaration of Polycarp of Adrumetum,<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
that "those who declare the baptism of heretics to
be valid, make ours of none effect," we answer, if that is the
baptism of heretics which is given by heretics, then that is
the baptism of the covetous and murderers which is given
by them within the Church. But if this be not their baptism,
neither is the other the baptism of heretics; and so it is
Christ's, by whomsoever it be given.</p>

know that all Scripture gives its testimony respecting saving
baptism, yet we ought to express our belief that heretics and
schismatics, coming to the Church with the semblance of
having been baptized, ought to be baptized in the unfailing
fountain; and that therefore, according to the testimony of
the Scriptures, and according to the decree of those most holy
men, our colleagues,<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> all schismatics and heretics who are
converted to the Church ought to be baptized; and that, moreover,
all that seemed to have received ordination should be
admitted as simple laymen."</p>

<p>17. Novatus of Thamugadis has stated what he has done;
but he has brought forward no proofs by which to show that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
he ought to have acted as he did. For he has made mention
of the testimony of the Scriptures, and the decree of his colleagues,
but he has not adduced out of them anything which
we could consider.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xii.</span>&mdash;18. Nemesianus of Tubun√¶<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> said: "That the
baptism which is given by heretics and schismatics is not
true is everywhere declared in the holy Scriptures, inasmuch
as their very prelates are false Christs and false prophets, as
the Lord declares by the mouth of Solomon, 'Whoso trusteth
in lies, the same feedeth the winds; he also followeth flying
birds. For he deserteth the ways of his own vineyard, and
hath strayed from the paths of his own field. For he walketh
through pathless and dry places, and a land destined to thirst;
and he gathereth fruitless weeds in his hands.'<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> And again,
'Abstain from strange water, and drink not of a strange
fountain, that thou mayest live long, and that years may be
added to thy life.'<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> And in the gospel our Lord Jesus Christ
spake with His own voice, saying, 'Except a man be born of
water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God.'<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> This is the Spirit which from the beginning 'moved
upon the face of the waters.'<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> For neither can the Spirit act
without the water, nor the water without the Spirit. Ill,
therefore, for themselves do some interpret, saying that by
imposition of hands they receive the Holy Ghost, and are
received into the Church, when it is manifest that they ought
to be born again by both sacraments<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> in the Catholic Church.
For then indeed will they be able to become the sons of God,
as the apostle says, 'Endeavouring to keep the unity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and one
Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one
Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God.'<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> All this the Catholic
Church asserts. And again he says in the gospel, 'That
which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of
the Spirit is spirit; for the Spirit is God, and is born of God.'<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>
Therefore all things whatsoever all heretics and schismatics
do are carnal, as the apostle says, 'Now the works of the
flesh are manifest, which are these; adultery, fornication,
uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,
emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, and such
like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you
in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit
the kingdom of God.'<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> The apostle condemns, equally with
all the wicked, those also who cause divisions, that is, schismatics
and heretics. Unless therefore they receive that saving
baptism which is one, and found only in the Catholic Church,
they cannot be saved, but will be condemned with the carnal
in the judgment of the Lord."</p>

<p>19. Nemesianus of Tubun√¶ has advanced many passages
of Scripture to prove his point; but he has in fact said
much on behalf of the view of the Catholic Church, which
we have undertaken to set forth and maintain. Unless,
indeed, we must suppose that he does not "trust in what is
false" who trusts in the hope of things temporal, as do all
covetous men and robbers, and those who renounce the world
in words but not in deeds, of whom Cyprian yet bears witness
that such men not only baptize, but even are baptized within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the Church.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> For they themselves also "follow flying birds,"<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
since they do not attain to what they desire. But not only
the heretic, but every one who leads an evil life, "deserteth
the ways of his own vineyard, and hath strayed from the
paths of his own field. And he walketh through pathless and
dry places, and a land destined to thirst; and he gathereth
fruitless weeds in his hands;" because all justice is fruitful,
and all iniquity is barren. Those, again, who "drink strange
water out of a strange fountain," are found not only among
heretics, but among all who do not live according to the
teaching of God, and do live according to the teaching of the
devil. For if he were speaking of baptism, he would not say,
"Do not drink of a strange fountain," but, do not wash thyself
in a strange fountain. Again, I do not see at all what aid he
gets towards proving his point from the words of our Lord,
"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God."<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> For it is one thing to say
that every one who shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
is first born again of water and the Spirit, because except a
man be born of water and of the Spirit, he shall not enter
into the kingdom of heaven, which is the Lord's saying, and
is true; another thing to say that every one who is born of
water and the Spirit shall enter into the kingdom of heaven,
which is assuredly false. For Simon Magus also was born of
water and of the Spirit,<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> and yet he did not enter into the
kingdom of heaven; and this may possibly be the case with
heretics as well. Or if only those are born of the Spirit who
are changed with a true conversion, all who renounce the
world in word and not in deed are assuredly not born of the
Spirit, but of water only, and yet they are within the Church,
according to the testimony of Cyprian. For we must perforce
grant one of two things,&mdash;either those who renounce the
world deceitfully are born of the Spirit, though it is to their
destruction, not to salvation, and therefore heretics may be so
born; or if what is written, that "the Holy Spirit of discipline
will flee deceit,"<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> extends to proving as much as this,
that those who renounce the world deceitfully are not born of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the Spirit, then a man may be baptized with water, and not
born of the Spirit, and Nemesianus says in vain that neither
the Spirit can work without the water, nor the water without
the Spirit. Indeed it has been already often shown how it is
possible that men should have one baptism in common who
have not one Church, as it is possible that in the body of the
Church herself those who are sanctified by their righteousness,
and those who are polluted through their covetousness, may
not have the same one Spirit, and yet have the same one
baptism. For it is said "one body," that is, the Church, just
as it is said "one Spirit" and "one baptism." The other
arguments which he has adduced rather favour our position.
For he has brought forward a proof from the gospel, in the
words, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that
which is born of the Spirit is spirit; for the Spirit is God,
and born of God;"<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> and he has advanced the argument that
therefore all things that are done by any heretic or schismatic
are carnal, as the apostle says, "The works of the flesh are
manifest, which are these; fornication, uncleanness;" and so
he goes through the list which the apostle there enumerates,
amongst which he has reckoned heresies, since "they who do
such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Then he
goes on to add, that "therefore the apostle condemns with all
wicked men those also who cause division, that is, schismatics
and heretics." And in this he does well, that when he enumerates
the works of the flesh, among which are also heresies,
he found and declared that the apostle condemns them all
alike. Let him therefore question the holy Cyprian himself,
and learn from him how many even within the Church live
according to the evil works of the flesh, which the apostle
condemns in common with the heresies, and yet these both
baptize and are baptized. Why then are heretics alone said
to be incapable of possessing baptism, which is possessed by
the very partners in their condemnation?</p>

that the baptism of Christ was not to be disavowed, even when
found among heretics. But if he had brought forward any

the Lord hath said in His gospel, 'Ye are the salt of the
earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, that which is
salted from it shall be thenceforth good for nothing, but to be
cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men;'<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> and seeing
that again, after His resurrection, when sending forth His
apostles, He commanded them, saying, 'All power is given
unto me in heaven and in earth: go ye therefore, and teach
all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,'<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>&mdash;since then it is plain that
heretics, that is, the enemies of Christ, have not the full confession
of the sacrament, also that schismatics cannot reason
with spiritual wisdom, since they themselves, by withdrawing
when they have lost their savour from the Church, which is
one, have become contrary to it,<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> let that be done which is
written, 'The houses of those that are opposed to the law
must needs be cleansed;'<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> and it therefore follows that those
who have been polluted by being baptized by men opposed to
Christ should first be cleansed, and only then baptized."</p>

<p>23. Lucius of Castrum Galb√¶ has brought forward a proof
from the gospel, in the words of the Lord, "Ye are the salt of
the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, that which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
salted from it shall be good for nothing, but to be cast out,
and to be trodden under foot of men;" just as though we
maintained that men when cast out were of any profit for the
salvation either of themselves or of any one else. But those
also who, though seeming to be within, are yet of such a kind,
not only are without spiritually, but will in the end be separated
in the body also. For all such are profitable for nothing.
But it does not therefore follow that the sacrament of baptism
which is in them is nothing. For even in the very men
who are cast out, if they return to their senses and come
back, the salvation which had departed from them returns;
but the baptism does not return, because it never had departed.
And in what the Lord says, "Go therefore, and
teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost," He did not permit
any to baptize except the good, inasmuch as He did not say
to the bad, "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted
unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are
retained."<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> How then do the wicked baptize within, who
cannot remit sins? How also is it that they baptize the
wicked whose hearts are not changed, whose sins are yet upon
them, as John says, "He that hateth his brother is in darkness
even until now?"<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> But if the sins of these men are
remitted when they join themselves in the close bonds of love
to the good and just, through whom sins are remitted in the
Church, though they have been baptized by the wicked, so
the sins of those also are remitted who come from without
and join themselves by the inner bond of peace to the same
framework of the body of Christ. Yet the baptism of Christ
should be acknowledged in both, and held invalid in none,
whether before they are converted, though then it profit them
nothing, or after they are converted, that so it may profit
them, as he says, "Since they themselves, by withdrawing
when they have lost their savour from the Church, which is
one, have become contrary to it, let that be done which is
written, 'The houses of those that are opposed to the law
must needs be cleansed.' And it therefore follows," he goes
on to say, "that those who have been polluted by being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
baptized by men opposed to Christ should first be cleansed,
and only then baptized." What then? Are thieves and
murderers not contrary to the law, which says, "Thou shalt
not kill; thou shalt not steal?"<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> "They must therefore needs
be cleansed." Who deny it? And yet not only those
who are baptized by such within the Church, but also those
who, being such themselves, are baptized without being changed
in heart, are nevertheless exempt from further baptism when
they are so changed. So great is the force of the sacrament
of mere baptism, that though we allow that a man who has
been baptized and continues to lead an evil life requires to be
cleansed, we yet forbid him to be any more baptized.</p>

our most beloved Cyprian to Jubaianus, and also to Stephen,<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
having been read in so large an assembly of our most holy
brethren in the priesthood, containing as they do so large a
body of sacred testimony derived from the Scriptures that
give us our God,<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> that we have every reason to assent to them,
being all united by the grace of God, I give my judgment that
all heretics or schismatics who wish to come to the Catholic
Church should not enter therein unless they have been first
exorcised and baptized; with the obvious exception of those
who have been originally baptized in the Catholic Church,
these being reconciled and admitted to the penance of the
Church by the imposition of hands."</p>

<p>25. Here we are warned once more to inquire why he
says, "Except, of course, those who have been originally
baptized in the Catholic Church." Is it because they had not
lost what they had before received? Why then could they
not also transmit outside the Church what they were able to
possess outside? Is it that outside it is unlawfully transmitted?
But neither is it lawfully possessed outside, and
yet it is possessed; so it is unlawfully given outside, but yet
it is given. But what is given to the person returning from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
heresy who had been baptized inside, is given to the person
coming to the Church who had been baptized outside,&mdash;that is,
that he may have lawfully inside what before he had unlawfully
outside. But perhaps some one may ask what was
said on this point in the letter of the blessed Cyprian to
Stephen, which is mentioned in this judgment, though not in
the opening address to the Council,&mdash;I suppose because it was
not considered necessary. For Crescens stated that the letter
itself had been read in the assembly, which I have no doubt
was done, if I am not mistaken, as is customary, in order that
the bishops, being already assembled, might receive some
information at the same time on the subject contained in
that letter. For it certainly has no bearing on the present
subject; and I am more surprised at Crescens having thought
fit to mention it at all, than at its having been passed over
in the opening address. But if any one thinks that I have
shrunk from bringing forward something which has been
urged in it that is essential to the present point, let him read
it and see that what I say is true; or if he finds it otherwise,
let him convict me of falsehood. For that letter contains
nothing whatsoever about baptism administered among
heretics or schismatics, which is the subject of our present
argument.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

of sins among sinners, neither can sinners within the Church
remit sins; and yet those who have been baptized by them

<p>29. To this we answer, That all who are baptized with the

the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost in the sacrament

name done many wonderful things?" with all the rest that
is there recorded, He shall at the last day answer, "I never

kind of chaff is destined for the fire, if it persevere to the
last in its wickedness, whether any part of it fly outside before
its winnowing, or whether it seem to be within. If,
therefore, those heretics who come to the Church are to be
again baptized, that they may be baptized by the friends of
God, are those covetous men, those robbers, murderers, the
friends of God, or must those whom they have baptized be
baptized afresh?</p>

baptizes a heretic, both fall together into death."</p>

<p>33. This is true, but it does not follow that what he adds
is true. "And therefore," he says, "the heretic must be
baptized and brought to life, lest we who are alive should hold
communion with the dead." Were they not dead who said,
"Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die?"<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> for they did
not believe in the resurrection of the dead. Those then who
were corrupted by their evil communications, and followed
them, were not they likewise falling with them into the pit?
And yet among them there were men to whom the apostle
was writing as being already baptized; nor would they, therefore,
if they were corrected, be baptized afresh. Does not the
same apostle say, "To be carnally-minded is death?"<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> and
certainly the covetous, the deceivers, the robbers, in the midst
of whom Cyprian himself was groaning, were carnally-minded.
What then? Did the dead hurt him who was living in unity?
or who would say, that because such men had or gave the
baptism of Christ, that it was therefore violated by their
iniquities?</p>

that a heretic should be baptized in the holy Church."</p>

to the sacrament of the heavenly grace of God which
we have received, we believe in the one only baptism which
is in the holy Church."</p>

<p>37. This may be my own judgment also. For it is so
balanced, that it contains nothing contrary to the truth. For
we also believe in the one only baptism which is in the holy
Church. Had he said, indeed, We believe in that which is in
the holy Church alone, the same answer must have been made
to him as to the rest. But as it is, since he has expressed
himself in this wise, "We believe in the one only baptism which
is in the holy Church," so that it is asserted that it exists in
the holy Church, but not denied that it may be elsewhere as
well, whatever his meaning may have been, there is no need
to argue against these words. For if I were questioned on
the several points, first, whether there was one baptism, I
should answer that there was one. Then if I were asked,
whether this was in the holy Church, I should answer that
it was. In the third place, if it were asked whether I
believed in this baptism, I should answer that I did so
believe; and consequently I should answer that I believed in
the one baptism which is in the holy Church. But if it were
asked whether it was found in the holy Church alone, and
not among heretics and schismatics, I should answer that, in
common with the whole Church, I believed the contrary. But
since he did not insert this in his judgment, I should consider
that it was mere wantonness if I added words which I did
not find there, for the sake of arguing against them. For if
he were to say, There is one water of the river Euphrates,
which is in Paradise, no one could gainsay the truth of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
he said. But if he were asked whether that water were in
Paradise and nowhere else, and were to say that this was so,
he would be saying what was false. For, besides Paradise,
it is also in those lands into which it flows from that source.
But who is rash enough to say that he would have been likely
to assert what is false, when it is quite possible that he was
asserting what is true? Wherefore the words of this judgment
require no contradiction, because they in no wise run
counter to the truth.</p>

lies within our power, refuse to communicate with a heretic,
unless he has been baptized in the Church, and received
remission of his sins."</p>

<p>39. The answer to this is: If your reason for wishing him
to be baptized is that he has not received remission of sins,
supposing you find a man within the Church who has been
baptized, though entertaining hatred towards his brother, since
the Lord cannot lie, who says, "If ye forgive not men their
trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses,"<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
will you bid such an one, when corrected, to be baptized
afresh? Assuredly not; so neither should you bid the heretic.
It is clear that we must not pass unnoticed why he did not
briefly say, "We do not communicate with a heretic," but
added, "so far as lies within our power." For he saw that a
greater number agreed with this view, from whose communion,
however, he and his friends could not separate themselves, lest
unity should be impaired, and so he added, "so far as lies
within our power,"&mdash;showing beyond all doubt that he did
not willingly communicate with those whom he held to be
without baptism, but that yet all things were to be endured
for the sake of peace and unity; just as was done also by
those who thought that Dativus and his party were in the
wrong, and who held what afterwards was taught by a fuller
declaration of the truth, and urged by ancient custom, which
received the stronger confirmation of a later Council; yet in
turn, with anxious piety, they showed toleration towards each
other, though without violation of Christian charity they en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>tertained
different opinions, endeavouring to keep the unity of

"Heretics may either do everything or nothing. If they can
baptize, they can also give the Holy Spirit; but if they cannot
give the Holy Spirit, because they do not possess the Holy
Spirit, then can they not either spiritually baptize. Therefore
we give our judgment that heretics should be baptized."</p>

<p>41. To this we may answer almost word for word: Murderers
may either do everything or nothing. If they can
baptize, they can also give the Holy Spirit; but if they cannot
give the Holy Spirit, because they do not possess the Holy
Spirit, then can they not either spiritually baptize. Therefore
we give our judgment that persons baptized by murderers, or
murderers themselves who have been baptized without being
converted, should, when they have corrected themselves, be
baptized. Yet this is not true. For "whosoever hateth his
brother is a murderer;"<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> and Cyprian knew such men within

Christ our Lord and God, the Son of God the Father and
Creator, built His Church upon a rock, not upon heresy, and
gave the power of baptizing to bishops, not to heretics.
Wherefore those who are outside the Church, and stand
against Christ, scattering His sheep and flock, cannot baptize
outside."</p>

<p>43. He added the word "outside" in order that he might
not be answered with a like brevity to Successus. For other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>wise
he might also have been answered word for word:
Jesus Christ our Lord and God, the Son of God the Father
and Creator, built His Church upon a rock, not upon iniquity,
and gave the power of baptizing to bishops, not to the unrighteous.
Wherefore those who do not belong to the rock
on which they build who hear the word of God and do it,<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>
but, living contrary to Christ in hearing the word and not
doing it, and hereby building on the sand, in this way scatter
His sheep and flock by the example of an abandoned character,
cannot baptize. Might not this be said with all the semblance
of truth? and yet it is false. For the unrighteous do
baptize, since those robbers are unrighteous whom Cyprian
maintained to be at unity with himself.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> But for this reason,
says the Donatist, he adds "outside." Why therefore can
they not baptize outside? Is it because they are worse from
the very fact that they are outside? But it makes no difference,
in respect of the validity of baptism, how much worse
the minister may be. For there is not so much difference
between bad and worse as between good and bad; and yet,
when the bad baptizes, he gives the selfsame sacrament as
the good. Therefore, also, when the worse baptizes, he gives
the selfsame sacrament as the less bad. Or is it that it is
not in respect of man's merit, but of the sacrament of baptism
itself, that it cannot be given outside? If this were so,
neither could it be possessed outside, and it would be necessary
that a man should be baptized again so often as he left
the Church and again returned to it.</p>

<p>44. Further, if we inquire more carefully what is meant by
"outside," especially as he himself makes mention of the rock
on which the Church is built, are not they in the Church
who are on the rock, and they who are not on the rock, not
in the Church either? Now, therefore, let us see whether
they build their house upon a rock who hear the words of
Christ and do them not. The Lord Himself declares the contrary,
saying, "Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and
doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built
his house upon a rock;" and a little later, "Every one that
heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the
sand."<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> If, therefore, the Church is on a rock, those who are
on the sand, because they are outside the rock, are necessarily
outside the Church. Let us recollect, therefore, how many
Cyprian mentions as placed within who build upon the sand,
that is, who hear the words of Christ and do them not. And
therefore, because they are on the sand, they are proved to be
outside the rock, that is, outside the Church; yet even while
they are so situated, and are either not yet or never changed
for the better, not only do they baptize and are baptized, but
the baptism which they have remains valid in them though
they are destined to damnation.</p>

<p>45. Neither can it be said in this place,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> Yet who is
there that doeth all the words of the Lord which are written
in the evangelic sermon itself, at the end of which He says,
that he who heard the said words and did them built upon a
rock, and he who heard them and did them not built upon
the sand? For, granting that by certain persons all the
words are not accomplished, yet in the same sermon He has
appointed the remedy, saying, "Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven."<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>
And after the Lord's prayer had been recorded in
detail in the same sermon, He says, "For I say unto you, if
ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will
also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses,
neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> Hence
also Peter says, "For charity shall cover the multitude of
sins;"<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> which charity they certainly did not have, and on
this account they built upon the sand, of whom the same
Cyprian says, that within the Church they held conversation,
even in the time of the apostles, in unkindly hatred alien
from Christian charity;<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> and therefore they seemed indeed to
be within, but really were without, because they were not on
that rock by which the Church is signified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxv.</span>&mdash;46. Sedatus of Tuburbo<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> said: "Inasmuch as
water, sanctified by the prayer of the priest in the Church,
washes away sins, just so much does it multiply sins when
infected, as by a cancer, with the words of heretics. Wherefore
one must strive, with all such efforts as conduce to peace,
that no one who has been infected and tainted by heretical
error should refuse to receive the one true baptism, with
which whosoever is not baptized shall not inherit the kingdom
of heaven."</p>

<p>47. To this we answer, that if the water is not sanctified,
when through want of skill the priest who prays utters some
words of error, many, not only of the bad, but of the good
brethren in the Church itself, fail to sanctify the water. For
the prayers of many are corrected every day on being recited
to men of greater learning, and many things are found in
them contrary to the Catholic faith. Supposing, then, that it
were shown that some persons were baptized when these
prayers had been uttered over the water, will they be bidden
to be baptized afresh? Why not? Because generally the
fault in the prayer is more than counterbalanced by the
intent of him who offers it; and those fixed words of the
gospel, without which baptism cannot be consecrated, are of
such efficacy, that, by their virtue, anything faulty that is
uttered in the prayer contrary to the rule of faith is made
of no effect, just as the devil is excluded by the name of
Christ. For it is clear that if a heretic utters a faulty prayer,
he has no good intent of love whereby that want of skill may
be compensated, and therefore he is like any envious or spiteful
person in the Catholic Church itself, such as Cyprian
proves to exist within the Church. Or one might offer some
prayer, as not unfrequently happens, in which he should
speak against the rule of faith, since many rush into the use
of prayers which are composed not only by unskilful men
who love to talk, but even by heretics, and in the simplicity
of ignorance, not being able to discern their true character,
use them, thinking they are good; and yet what is erroneous
in them does not vitiate what is right, but rather it is rendered
null thereby, just as in the man of good hope and approved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
faith, who yet is but a man, if in anything he be otherwise
minded, what he holds aright is not thereby vitiated until God
reveal to him also that in which he is otherwise minded.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> But
supposing that the man himself is wicked and perverse, then,
if he should offer an upright prayer, in no part contrary to
the Catholic faith, it does not follow that because the prayer
is right the man himself is also right; and if over some he
offers an erroneous prayer, God is present to uphold the words
of His gospel, without which the baptism of Christ cannot be
consecrated, and He Himself consecrates His sacrament, that
in the recipient, either before he is baptized, or when he is
baptized, or at some future time when he turns in truth to
God, that very sacrament may be profitable to salvation, which,
were he not to be converted, would be powerful to his destruction.
But who is there who does not know that there is no
baptism of Christ, if the words of the gospel in which consists
the outward visible sign be not forthcoming? But you will
more easily find heretics who do not baptize at all, than any
who baptize without those words. And therefore we say, not
that every baptism (for in many of the blasphemous rites of
idols men are said to be baptized), but that the baptism of
Christ, that is, every baptism consecrated in the words of the
gospel, is everywhere the same, and cannot be vitiated by any
perversity on the part of any men.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>48. We must certainly not lightly pass over in this judgment
that he here inserted a clause, and says, "Wherefore
we must strive, with all such efforts as conduce to peace,
that no one who has been infected," etc. For he had regard
to those words of the blessed Cyprian in his opening speech,
"Judging no man, nor depriving any of the right of communion
if he entertain a different view." See of what power
is the love of unity and peace in the good sons of the Church,
that they should choose rather to show tolerance towards those
whom they called sacrilegious and profane, being admitted,
as they thought, without the sacrament of baptism, if they
could not correct them as they thought was right, than on
their account to break that holy bond, lest on account of the
tares the wheat also should be rooted out,<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>&mdash;permitting, so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
as rested with them, as in that noblest judgment of Solomon,
that the infant body should rather be nourished by the false
mother than be cut in pieces.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> But this was the opinion
both of those who held the truer view about the sacrament of
baptism, and of those to whom God, in consideration of their
great love, was purposing to reveal any point in which they
were otherwise minded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxvi.</span>&mdash;49. Privatianus of Sufetula<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> said: "He who
says that heretics have the power of baptizing should first say
who it was that founded heresy. For if heresy is of God, it
may have the divine favour; but if it be not of God, how
can it either have or confer on any one the grace of God?"</p>

<p>50. This man may thus be answered word for word: He
who says that malicious and envious persons have the power
of baptizing, should first say who was the founder of malice
and envy. For if malice and envy are of God, they may
have the divine favour; but if they are not of God, how can
they either have or confer on any one the grace of God?
But as these words are in the same way most manifestly false,
so are also those which these were uttered to confute. For
the malicious and envious baptize, as even Cyprian himself
allows, because he bears testimony that they also are within.
So therefore even heretics may baptize, because baptism is
the sacrament of Christ; but envy and heresy are the works
of the devil. Yet though a man possesses them, he does not
thereby cause that if he have the sacrament of Christ, it also
should itself be reckoned in the number of the devil's works.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxvii.</span>&mdash;51. Privatus of Sufes said: "What can be
said of the man who approves the baptism of heretics, save
that he communicates with heretics?"</p>

<p>52. To this we answer: It is not the baptism of heretics
which we approve in heretics, as it is not the baptism of the
covetous, or the treacherous, or deceitful, or of robbers, or of
envious men which we approve in them; for all of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
are unjust, but Christ is just, whose sacrament existing in
them, they do not in its essence violate. Otherwise another
man might say: What can be said of the man who approves
the baptism of the unjust, save that he communicates with
the unjust? And if this objection were brought against the
Catholic Church herself, it would be answered just as I have
answered the above.</p>

many baptisms there are, let those who uphold or favour
heretics determine. We assert one baptism of the Church,
which we only know in the Church. Or how can those
baptize any one in the name of Christ whom Christ Himself
declares to be His enemies?"</p>

<p>54. Giving answer to this man in a like tenor of words,
we say: Let those who uphold or favour the unrighteous see
to it: we recall to the Church when we can the one baptism
which we know to be of the Church alone, wherever it be
found. Or how can they baptize any one in the name of
Christ whom Christ Himself declares to be His enemies? For
He says to all the unrighteous, "I never knew you: depart
from me, ye that work iniquity;"<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> and yet, when they baptize,

there cannot be two baptisms, he who grants baptism unto
heretics takes it away from himself. I therefore declare my
judgment that heretics, those objects for our tears, those masses
of corruption,<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> should be baptized when they begin to come to
the Church, and that so being washed by the sacred and
divine laver, and enlightened with the light of life, they may
be received into the Church,&mdash;as being now made not enemies,
but peaceful; not strangers, but of the household of the faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
of the Lord; not bastards,<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> but sons of God; partaking not of
error, but of salvation,&mdash;with the exception of those who, being
believers transplanted from the Church, had gone over to
heresy, and that these should be restored by the laying on of
hands."</p>

<p>56. Another might say: Since there cannot be two baptisms,
he who grants baptism to the unrighteous takes it away from
himself. But even our opponents would join us in resisting such
a man when he says that we grant baptism to the unrighteous,
which is not of the unrighteous, like their unrighteousness,
but of Christ, of whom is righteousness, and whose sacrament,
even among the unrighteous, is not unrighteous. What, therefore,
they would join us in saying of the unrighteous, that let
them say to themselves of heretics. And therefore he should
rather have said as follows: I therefore give my judgment
that heretics, those objects for our tears, those masses of corruption,
should not be baptized when they begin to come to
the Church, if they already have the baptism of Christ, but
should be corrected from their error. For we may similarly
say of the unrighteous, of whom the heretics are a part: I
therefore give my judgment that the unrighteous, those objects
for our tears, and masses of corruption, if they have been
already baptized, should not be baptized again when they
begin to come to the Church, that is, to that rock outside
which are all who hear the words of Christ and do them not;
but, being already washed with the sacred and divine laver,
and now further enlightened with the light of truth, should
be received into the Church no longer as enemies but as
peaceful, for the unrighteous have no peace; no longer as
strangers, but of the household of the faith of the Lord, for to
the unrighteous it is said, "How then art thou turned into
the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?"<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> no longer
as bastards, but the sons of God, for the unrighteous are the
sons of the devil, partaking not of error but of salvation, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
unrighteousness cannot save. And by the Church I mean
that rock, that dove, that garden enclosed and fountain sealed,
which is recognised only in the wheat, not in the chaff,
whether that be scattered far apart by the wind, or appear to
be mingled with the corn even till the last winnowing. In
vain, therefore, did Cassius add, "With the exception of those
who, being believers transplanted from the Church, had gone
over to heresy." For if even they themselves had lost baptism
by seceding, to themselves also let it be restored; but if they
had not lost it, let what was given by them receive due recognition.</p>

said: "If error does not obey truth, much more does truth
refuse assent to error; and therefore we stand by the Church
in which we preside, so that, claiming her baptism for herself
alone, we baptize those whom the Church has not baptized."</p>

<p>58. We answer: Whom the Church baptizes, those that
rock baptizes outside which are all they who hear the words
of Christ and do them not. Let all, therefore, be baptized
again who have been baptized by such. But if this is not
done, then, as we recognise the baptism of Christ in these, so
should we recognise it in heretics, though we either condemn

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxi.</span>&mdash;59. Another Secundinus of Carpis<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> said:
"Are heretics Christians or not? If they are Christians, why
are they not in the Church of God? If they are not Christians,
let them be made so.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> Else what will be the reference
in the discourse of the Lord, in which He says, 'He that is
not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with
me scattereth abroad?'<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> Whence it is clear that on strange
children and the offspring of Antichrist the Holy Spirit cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
descend by the laying on of hands alone, since it is clear that
heretics have not baptism."</p>

<p>60. To this we answer: Are the unrighteous Christians or
not? If they are Christians, why are they not on that rock
on which the Church is built? for they hear the words of
Christ and do them not. If they are not Christians, let
them be made so. Else what will be the reference in the
discourse of our Lord, in which He says, "He that is not
with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me
scattereth abroad?" For they scatter His sheep who lead
them to the ruin of their lives by a false imitation of the
Lord. Whence it is clear that upon strange children (as all
the unrighteous are called), and upon the offspring of Antichrist
(which all are who oppose themselves to Christ), the
Holy Spirit cannot descend by the laying on of hands alone,
if there be not added a true conversion of the heart; since it
is clear that the unrighteous, so long as they are unrighteous,
may indeed have baptism, but cannot have the salvation of
which baptism is the sacrament. For let us see whether
heretics are described in that psalm where the following
words are used of strange children: "Deliver me, O Lord,
from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh
vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:
whose sons are like young shoots well established, and their
daughters polished after the similitude of the temple. Their
garners are full, affording all manner of store; their sheep are
fruitful, bringing forth plenteously in their streets; their oxen
are strong: there is no breaking down of their fence, no opening
of a passage out, no complaining in their streets. Men
deemed happy the people that is in such a case; rather
blessed is the people whose God is the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> If, therefore,
those are strange children who place their happiness in temporal
things, and in the abundance of earthly prosperity, and
despise the commandments of the Lord, let us see whether
these are not the very same of whom Cyprian so speaks,
making himself also as one of them, that he may show that
he is speaking of men with whom he held communion in the
sacraments: "In not keeping," he says, "the way of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Lord, nor observing the heavenly commandments given us
for our salvation. Our Lord did the will of His Father, and
we do not do the will of the Lord, being eager about our
patrimony or our gains, following after pride, and so forth."<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>
But if these could both have and transmit baptism, why is it
denied that it may exist among strange children, whom he
yet exhorts, that, by keeping the heavenly commandments conveyed
to them through the only-begotten Son, they should
deserve to be His brethren and the sons of God?</p>

heretics may baptize, and give remission of sins, why do we
destroy their credit, and call them heretics?"</p>

<p>62. What if another were to say: If the unrighteous may
baptize, and give remission of sins, why do we destroy their
credit, and call them unrighteous? The answer which we
should give to such an one concerning the unrighteous may
also be given to the other concerning heretics,&mdash;that is, in the
first place, that the baptism with which they baptize is not
theirs; and secondly, that it does not follow that whosoever
has the baptism of Christ is also certain of the remission of
his sins, if he has this only in the outward sign, and is not
converted with a true conversion of the heart, so that he who
gives remission should himself have remission of his sins.</p>

one can doubt, most holy brethren in the priesthood, that
human presumption has not so much power as the adorable
and venerable majesty of our Lord Jesus Christ. Remembering
then the danger, we ought not only to observe this ourselves,
but to confirm it by our general consent, that all
heretics who come to the bosom of our mother the Church
be baptized, that the heretical mind, which has been polluted
by long-continued corruption, may be reformed when
cleansed by the sanctification of the laver."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>64. Perhaps the man who has placed the strength of his
case for the baptizing of heretics in the cleansing away of
the long-continued corruption, would spare those who, having
fallen headlong into some heresy, had remained in it a brief
space, and presently being corrected, had passed from thence
to the Catholic Church. Furthermore, he has himself failed
to observe that it might be said that all unrighteous persons
who come to that rock, in which is understood the Church,
should be baptized, so that the unrighteous mind, which was
building outside the rock upon the sand by hearing the
words of Christ and not doing them, might be reformed when
cleansed by the sanctification of the laver; and yet this is
not done if they have been baptized already, even if it be
proved that such was their character when they were baptized,
that is, that they renounced the world in words and not in
deeds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxiv.</span>&mdash;65. Quietus of Burug<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> said: "We who live
by faith ought with believing observance to obey what has
been before foretold for our instruction. For it is written in
Solomon, 'He that is washed by one dead, what availeth his
washing?'<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> Which assuredly he says of those who are
washed by heretics, and of those who wash. For if they
who are baptized among them receive eternal life through
the remission of their sins, why do they come to the Church?
But if no salvation is received from a dead person, and they
therefore, acknowledging their former error, return with penance
to the truth, they ought to be sanctified with the one
life-giving baptism which is in the Catholic Church."</p>

<p>66. What it is to be baptized by the dead, we have already,
without prejudice to the more careful consideration of the
same scripture, sufficiently declared before.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> But I would
ask why it is that they wish heretics alone to be considered
dead, when Paul the apostle has said generally of sin, "The
wages of sin is death;"<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> and again, "To be carnally minded is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
death."<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> And when he says that a widow that liveth in
pleasure is dead,<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> how are they not dead who renounce the
world in words and not in deeds? What, therefore, is the
profit of washing in him who is baptized by them, except,
indeed, that if he himself also is of the same character, he
has the laver indeed, but it does not profit him to salvation?
But if he by whom he is baptized is such, but the man who
is baptized is turned to the Lord with no false heart, he is
not baptized by that dead person, but by that living One of
whom it is said, "The same is He which baptizeth."<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> But
to what he says of heretics, that if they who are baptized
among them receive eternal life through the remission of
their sins, why do they come to the Church? we answer:
They come for this reason, that although they have received
the baptism of Christ up to the point of the celebration of
the sacrament, yet they cannot attain to life eternal save
through the charity of unity; just as neither would those
envious and malicious ones attain to life eternal, who would
not have their sins forgiven them, even if they entertained
hatred only against those from whom they suffered wrong;
since the Truth said, "If ye forgive not men their trespasses,
neither will your Father forgive your trespasses,"<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> how much
less when they were hating those towards whom they were
rewarding evil for good?<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> And yet these men, though
renouncing the world in words and not in deeds, would not
be baptized again, if they should afterwards be corrected, but
they would be made holy by the one living baptism. And this
is indeed in the Catholic Church, but not in it alone, as neither
is it in the saints alone who are built upon the rock, and of
whom that one dove is composed.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxv.</span>&mdash;67. Castus of Sicca<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> said: "He who presumes
to follow custom in despite of truth is either envious
and evilly disposed towards the brethren to whom the truth
is revealed, or else he is ungrateful towards God, by whose
inspiration His Church is instructed."</p>

<p>68. If this man proved that those who differed from him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
and held the view that has since been held by the whole
world under the sanction of a general Council, were following
custom so as to despise truth, we should have reason for fearing
these words; but seeing that this custom is found both to
have had its origin in truth and to have been confirmed by
truth, we have nothing to fear in this judgment. And yet,
if they were envious or evilly disposed towards the brethren,
or ungrateful towards God, see with what kind of men they
were willing to hold communion; see what kind of men,
holding different opinions from their own, they treated as
Cyprian enjoined them at the first, not removing them from
the right of communion; see by what kind of men they were
not polluted in the preservation of unity; see how greatly the
bond of peace was to be loved; see what views they hold who
bring charges against us, founded on the Council of bishops,
their predecessors, whose example they do not imitate, and
by whose example, when the rights of the case are considered,
they are condemned. If it was the custom, as this judgment
bears witness, that heretics coming to the Church should be
received with the baptism which they already had, either this
was done rightly, or the evil do not pollute the good in unity.
If it was rightly done, why do they accuse the world because
they are so received? But if the evil do not pollute the good
in unity, how do they defend themselves against the charge
of sacrilegious separation?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxvi.</span>&mdash;69. Eucratius of Then√¶<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> said: "Our God
and Lord Jesus Christ, teaching the apostles with His own
mouth, fully laid down our faith, and the grace of baptism,
and the rule of the law of the Church, saying, 'Go ye, and
teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.'<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> Therefore the false
and unrighteous baptism of heretics is to be repudiated by us,
and contradicted with all solemnity of witness, seeing that
from their mouth issues not life, but poison, not heavenly
grace, but blaspheming of the Trinity. And so it is plain
that heretics coming to the Church ought to be baptized with
perfect and Catholic baptism, that, being purified from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
blasphemy of their presumption, they may be reformed by the
grace of the Holy Spirit."</p>

<p>70. Clearly, if the baptism is not consecrated in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, it
should be considered to be of the heretics, and repudiated
as unrighteous by us with all solemnity of witness; but if
we discern this name in it, we do better to distinguish the
words of the gospel from heretical error, and approve what
is sound in them, correcting what is faulty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxvii.</span>&mdash;71. Libosus of Vaga<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> said: "The Lord says
in the gospel, 'I am the truth;'<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> He did not say, I am custom.
Therefore, when the truth is made manifest, let custom yield
to truth; so that, if even in time past any one did not baptize
heretics in the Church, he may now begin to baptize them."</p>

<p>72. Here he has in no way tried to show how that is the
truth to which he says that custom ought to yield. But it is
of more importance that he helps us against those who have
separated themselves from unity, by confessing that the custom
existed, than that he thinks it ought to yield to a truth which
he does not show. For the custom is of such a nature, that if
it admitted sacrilegious men to the altar of Christ without the
cleansing of baptism, and polluted none of the good men who
remained in unity, then all who have cut themselves off from
the same unity, in which they could not be polluted by the
contagion of any evil persons whatsoever, have separated
themselves without reason, and have committed the manifest
sacrilege of schism. But if all perished in pollution
through that custom, from what cavern do they issue without
the original truth, and with all the cunning of calumny? If,
however, the custom was a right one by which heretics were
thus received, let them abandon their madness, let them confess
their error; let them come to the Catholic Church, not
that they may be bathed again with the sacrament of baptism,
but that they may be cured from the wound of severance.</p>

men, who with various words pluck away the sacred and
adorable words of the Scriptures, should be held accursed,

that therefore they should be exorcised and rebaptized; for
it is their own falsehood which I hold accursed, but Christ's

this same judgment, that heretics should be baptized."</p>

<p>76. To him we answer: But this is not the judgment
which the Church pronounces, to which also God has now

then still otherwise minded;<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> but because your charity was
unimpaired, ye remained in unity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xl.</span>&mdash;77. Also another Felix of Ammacura<a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> said:
"I too, following the authority of the holy Scriptures, give
my judgment that heretics should be baptized, and with
them those also who maintain that they have been baptized
among schismatics. For if, according to the warning of
Christ, our fountain is sealed to ourselves,<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> let all the
enemies of our Church understand that it cannot belong
to others; nor can He who is the Shepherd of our flock
give the water unto salvation to two different peoples. And
therefore it is clear that neither heretics nor schismatics can
receive anything heavenly, who dare to accept from men that
are sinners and aliens from the Church. When the giver has
no ground to stand upon, surely neither can the receiver
derive any profit."</p>

<p>78. To him we answer, that the holy Scriptures nowhere
have enjoined that heretics baptized among heretics should
be baptized afresh, but that they have shown in many places
that all are aliens from the Church who are not on the rock,
nor belong to the members of the dove, and yet that they
baptize and are baptized, and have the sacrament of salvation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
without salvation. But how our fountain is like the fountain
of Paradise, in that, like it, it flows forth even beyond the
bounds of Paradise, has been sufficiently set forth above;<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>
and that He who is the Shepherd of our flock cannot give
the water unto salvation to two different peoples, that is, to
one that is His own, and to another that is alien, I fully agree
in admitting. But does it follow that because the water is
not unto salvation it is not the identical water? For the
water of the deluge was for salvation unto those who were
placed within the ark, but it brought death to those without,
and yet it was the same water. And many aliens, that is to
say, envious persons, whom Cyprian declares and proves from
Scripture to be of the party of the devil, seem as it were to
be within, and yet, if they were not without the ark, they
would not perish by water. For such men are slain by
baptism, as the sweet savour of Christ was unto death to
those of whom the apostle speaks.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> Why then do not either
heretics or schismatics receive anything heavenly, just as
thorns or tares, like those who were without the ark received
indeed the rain from the floods of heaven, but to
destruction, not to salvation? And so I do not take the
pains to refute what he said in conclusion: "When the giver
has no ground to stand upon, surely neither can the receiver
derive any profit," since we also say that it does not profit the
receivers while they receive it in heresy, consenting with the
heretics; and therefore they come to Catholic peace and unity,
not that they may receive baptism, but that what they had
received may begin to profit them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xli.</span>&mdash;79. Also another Januarius of Muzuli<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> said:
"I wonder that, while all acknowledge that there is one
baptism, all do not understand the unity of the same baptism.
For the Church and heresy are two distinct things. If heretics
have baptism, we have it not; but if we have it, heretics cannot
have it. But there is no doubt that the Church alone
possesses the baptism of Christ, since it alone possesses both
the favour and the truth of Christ."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>80. Another might equally say, and say with equal want
of truth: I wonder that, while all confess there is one baptism,
all do not understand the unity of baptism. For righteousness
and unrighteousness are two distinct things. If the
unrighteous have baptism, the righteous have it not; but if
the righteous have it, the unrighteous cannot have it. But
there is no doubt that the righteous alone possess the baptism
of Christ, since they alone possess both the favour and the
truth of Christ. This is certainly false, as they confess themselves.
For those envious ones also who are of the party of
the devil, though placed within the Church, as Cyprian tells
us, and who were well known to the Apostle Paul, had
baptism, but did not belong to the members of that dove
which is safely sheltered on the rock.</p>

surely without cause that they find fault with the truth in
false and invidious terms, saying that we rebaptize, since the
Church does not rebaptize heretics, but baptize them."</p>

<p>82. Truly enough it does not rebaptize them, because it
only baptizes those who were not baptized before; and this
earlier custom has only been confirmed in a later Council by
a more careful perfecting of the truth.</p>

"We uphold one baptism, because we claim for the Catholic
Church alone what is her own. But those who say that
heretics baptize truly and lawfully are themselves the men
who make, not two, but many baptisms; for since heresies
are many in number, the baptisms, too, will be reckoned
according to their number."</p>

<p>84. To him we answer: If this were so, then would as
many baptisms be reckoned as there are works of the flesh,
of which the apostle says "that they which do such things
shall not inherit the kingdom of God;"<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> among which are
reckoned also heresies; and so many of those very works are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
tolerated within the Church as though in the chaff, and yet
there is one baptism for them all, which is not vitiated by
any work of unrighteousness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xliv.</span>&mdash;85. Vincentius of Thibaris<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> said: "We know
that heretics are worse than heathens. If they, being converted,
wish to come to God, they have assuredly a rule of
truth, which the Lord by His divine precept committed to
the apostles, saying, 'Go ye, lay on hands in my name, cast
out devils;'<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> and in another place, 'Go ye, and teach all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.'<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> Therefore, first by the
laying on of hands in exorcism, secondly by regeneration in
baptism, they may come to the promises of Christ; but my
judgment is that in no other way should this be done."</p>

<p>86. By what rule he asserts that heretics are worse than
heathens I do not know, seeing that the Lord says, "If he
neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an
heathen man and a publican."<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> Is a heretic worse even
than such? I do not gainsay it. I do not, however, allow
that because the man himself is worse than a heathen, that
is, than a Gentile and pagan, therefore whatever the sacrament
contains that is Christ's is mingled with his vices and
character, and perishes through the corruption of such admixture.
For if even those who depart from the Church, and
become not the followers but the founders of heresies, have
been baptized before their secession, they continue to have
baptism, although, according to the above rule, they are worse
than heathens; for if on correction they return, they do not
receive it, as they certainly would do if they had lost it. It
is therefore possible that a man may be worse than a heathen,
and yet that the sacrament of Christ may not only be in him,
but be not a whit inferior to what it is in a holy and righteous
man. For although to the extent of his powers he has not
preserved the sacrament, but done it violence in heart and
will, yet so far as the sacrament's own nature is concerned,
it has remained unhurt in its integrity even in the man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
despised and rejected it. Were not the people of Sodom
heathens, that is to say, Gentiles? The Jews therefore were
worse, to whom the Lord says, "It shall be more tolerable for
the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee;"<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>
and to whom the prophet says, "Thou hast justified Sodom,"<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>
that is to say, in comparison with thee Sodom is righteous.
Shall we, however, maintain that on this account the holy
sacraments which existed among the Jews partook of the
nature of the Jews themselves,&mdash;those sacraments which the
Lord Himself also accepted, and sent the lepers whom He
had cleansed to fulfil them,<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> of which, when Zacharias was administering
them, the angel stood by him, and declared that
his prayer had been heard while he was sacrificing in the
temple?<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> These same sacraments were both in the good
men of that time, and in those bad men who were worse
than are the heathens, seeing that they were ranked before
the Sodomites for wickedness, and yet those sacraments were
perfect and holy in both.</p>

<p>87. For even if the Gentiles themselves could have anything
holy and right in their doctrines, our saints did not
condemn it, however much the Gentiles themselves were to
be detested for their superstitions and idolatry and pride, and
the rest of their corruptions, and to be punished with judgment
from heaven, unless they submitted to correction. For
when Paul the apostle also was saying something concerning
God before the Athenians, he adduced as a proof of what he
said, that certain of them had said something to the same
effect,<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> which certainly would not be condemned but recognised
in them if they should come to Christ. And the holy
Cyprian uses similar evidence against the same heathens; for,
speaking of the magi, he says, "The chief of them, however,
Hostanes, asserts both that the form of the true God cannot
be seen, and also that true angels stand beside His seat. In
which Plato also agrees in like manner, and, maintaining the
existence of one God, he calls the others angels or demons.
Hermes Trismegistus also speaks of one God, and confesses
that He is incomprehensible, and past our powers of estima<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>tion."<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
If, therefore, they were to come to the perception of
salvation in Christ, it surely would not be said to them, This
that ye have is bad, or false; but clearly it would deservedly
be said, Though this in you is perfect and true, yet it would
profit nothing unless ye came to the grace of Christ. If,
therefore, anything that is holy can be found and rightly
approved in the very heathens, although the salvation which
is of Christ is not yet to be granted to them, we ought not,
even though heretics are worse than they, to be moved to the
desire of correcting what is bad in them belonging to themselves,
without being willing to acknowledge what is good in
them of Christ. But we will set forth from a fresh preface
to consider the remaining judgments of this Council.</p>

<h2><a name="BOOK_SEVENTH" id="BOOK_SEVENTH">BOOK SEVENTH.</a></h2>

<p class="center"><small>IN WHICH THE REMAINING JUDGEMENTS OF THE COUNCIL OF CARTHAGE ARE
EXAMINED.</small></p>


<p class="cap">CHAP. I.&mdash;1. Let us not be considered troublesome to
our readers, if we discuss the same question often and
from different points of view. For although the holy Catholic
Church throughout all nations be fortified by the authority
of primitive custom and of a general Council against those
arguments which throw some darkness over the question
about baptism, whether it can be the same among heretics
and schismatics that it is in the Catholic Church, yet, since
a different opinion has at one time been entertained in the
unity of the Church itself, by men who are in nowise to be
despised, and especially by Cyprian, whose authority men
endeavour to use against us who are far removed from his
charity, we are therefore compelled to make use of the
opportunity of examining and considering all that we find
on this subject in his Council and letters, in order, as it were,
to handle at some considerable length this same question,
and to show how it has more truly been the decision of the
whole body of the Catholic Church, that heretics or schismatics,
who have received baptism already in the body from
which they came, should be admitted with it into the communion
of the Catholic Church, being corrected in their error,
and rooted and grounded in the faith, that, so far as concerns
the sacrament of baptism, there should not be an addition of
something that was wanting, but a turning to profit of what
was in them. And the holy Cyprian indeed, now that the
corruptible body no longer presseth down the soul, nor the
earthly tabernacle presseth down the mind that museth upon
many things,<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> sees with greater clearness that truth to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
his charity made him deserving to attain. May he therefore
help us by his prayers, while we labour in the mortality
of the flesh as in a darksome cloud, that if the Lord so grant
it, we may imitate so far as we can the good that was in
him. But if he thought otherwise than right on any point,
and persuaded certain of his brethren and colleagues to entertain
his views in a matter which he now sees clearly through
the revelation of Him whom he loved, let us, who are far
inferior to his merits, yet following, as our weakness will
allow, the authority of the Catholic Church of which he was
himself a conspicuous and most noble member, strive our
utmost against heretics and schismatics, seeing that they,
being cut off from the unity which he maintained, and barren
of the love with which he was fruitful, and fallen away from
the humility in which he stood, are disavowed and condemned
the more by him, in proportion as he knows that they wish
to search out his writings for purposes of treachery, and are
unwilling to imitate what he did for the maintenance of
peace,&mdash;like those who, calling themselves Nazarene Christians,
and circumcising the foreskin of their flesh after the
fashion of the Jews, being heretics by birth in that error
from which Peter, when straying from the truth, was recalled
by Paul,<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> persist in the same to the present day. As therefore
they have remained in their perversity cut off from the body
of the Church, while Peter has been crowned in the primacy
of the apostles through the glory of martyrdom, so these
men, while Cyprian, through the abundance of his love, has
been received into the portion of the saints through the
brightness of his passion, are obliged to recognise themselves
as exiles from unity, and, in defence of their calumnies, set up
a citizen of unity as an opponent against the very home of
unity. Let us therefore go on to examine the other judgments
of that Council after the same fashion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ii.</span>&mdash;2. Marcus of Mactaris<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> said: "It is not to be
wondered at if heretics, being enemies and opponents of the
truth, claim to themselves what has been entrusted and vouchsafed
to other men. What is marvellous is that some of us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
traitors to the truth, uphold heretics and oppose Christians;
therefore we decree that heretics should be baptized."</p>

<p>3. To him we answer: It is indeed much more to be
wondered at, and deserving of expressions of great praise, that
Cyprian and his colleagues had such love for unity that they
continued in unity with those whom they considered to be
traitors to the truth, without any apprehension of being polluted
by them. For when Marcus said, "It is marvellous that
some of us, traitors to the truth, uphold heretics and oppose
Christians," it seemed natural that he should add, Therefore
we decree that communion should not be held with them.
This he did not say; but what he does say is, "Therefore we
decree that heretics should be baptized," adhering to what the
peaceful Cyprian had enjoined in the first instance, saying,
"Judging no man, nor removing any from the right of communion
if he entertain a different opinion." While, therefore,
the Donatists calumniate us and call us <i>traditors</i>, I should
be glad to know, supposing that any Jew or pagan were found,
who, after reading the records of that Council, should call both
us and them, according to their own rules, traitors to the truth,
how we should be able to make our joint defence so as to
refute and wash away so grave a charge. They give the
name of <i>traditors</i> to men whom they were never able in times
past to convict of the offence, and whom they cannot now show
to be involved in it, being themselves rather shown to be
liable to the same charge. But what has this to do with us?
What shall we say of them who, by their own showing, are
unquestionably traitors? For if we, however falsely, are called
<i>traditors</i>, because, as they allege, we took part in the same
communion with <i>traditors</i>, we have all taken part with the
traitors in question, seeing that in the time of the blessed
Cyprian the party of Donatus had not yet separated itself
from unity. For the delivery of the sacred books, from which
they began to be called <i>traditors</i>, occurred somewhat more
than forty years after his martyrdom. If, therefore, we are
<i>traditors</i>, because we sprang from <i>traditors</i>, as they believe
or pretend, we both of us derive our origin from those other
traitors. For there is no room for saying that they did not
communicate with these traitors, since they call them men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
their own party. In the words of the Council which they are
most forward to quote, "Some of us," it declares, "traitors to
the truth, uphold heretics." To this is added the testimony
of Cyprian, showing clearly that he remained in communion
with them when he says, "Judging no man, nor removing
any from the right of communion if he entertain a different
opinion." For those who entertained a different opinion were
the very persons whom Marcus calls traitors to the truth
because they upheld heretics, as he maintains, by receiving
them into the Church without baptism. That it was, moreover,
the custom that they should be so received, is testified
both by Cyprian himself in many passages, and by some bishops
in this Council. Whence it is evident that, if heretics have
not baptism, the Church of Christ of those days was full of
traitors, who upheld them by receiving them in this way. I
would urge, therefore, that we plead our cause in common
against the charge of treason which they cannot disavow, and
therein our special case will be argued against the charge of
delivering the books, which they could not prove against us.
But let us argue the point as though they had convicted us;
and what we shall answer jointly to those who urge against
both of us the general treason of our forefathers, that we will
answer to these men who urge against us that our forefathers
gave up the sacred books. For as we were dead because our
forefathers delivered up the books, which caused them to divide
themselves from us, so both we and they themselves are dead
through the treason of our forefathers, from whom both we and
they are sprung. But since they say they live, they hold that
that treason does not in any way affect them, therefore neither
are we affected by the delivery of the books. And it should
be observed that, according to them, the treason is indisputable:
while, according to us, there is no truth either in the
former charge of treason, because we say that heretics also may
have the baptism of Christ; nor in the latter charge of delivering
the books, because in that they were themselves beaten.
They have therefore no reason for separating themselves by
the wicked sin of schism, because, if our forefathers were not
guilty of delivering up the books, as we say, there is no charge
which can affect us at all; but if they were guilty of the sin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
as these men say, then it is just as far from affecting us as
the sin of those other traitors is from affecting either us or
them. And hence, since there is no charge that can implicate
us from the unrighteousness of our forefathers, the charge
arising against them from their own schism is manifestly
proved.</p>

forgiveness of their sins in their own baptism, it is
without reason that they come to the Church. For since it is
for sins that men are punished in the day of judgment, heretics
have nothing to fear in the judgment of Christ if they have
obtained remission of their sins."</p>

<p>5. This too might also have been our own judgment; but
let its author beware in what spirit it was said. For it is
expressed in terms of such import, that I should feel no compunction
in consenting and subscribing to it in the same spirit
in which I too believe that heretics may indeed have the
baptism of Christ, but cannot have the remission of their sins.
But he does not say, If heretics baptize or are baptized, but
"If heretics," he says, "receive forgiveness of their sins in
their own baptism, it is without reason that they come to the
Church." For if we were to set in the place of heretics those
whom Cyprian knew within the Church as renouncing the
world in words alone and not in deeds, we also might express
this same judgment, in just so many words, with the most
perfect truth. If those who only seem to be converted receive
forgiveness of their sins in their own baptism, it is without
reason that they are afterwards led on to a true conversion.
For since it is for sins that men are punished in the day of
judgment, those who renounce the world in words and not in
deeds have nothing to fear in the judgment of Christ if they
have obtained remission of their sins. But this reasoning is
only made perfect by some such context as is formed by the
addition of the words. But they ought to fear the judgment
of Christ, and to lose no time in being converted in the truth
of their hearts; and when they have done this, it is certainly
not necessary that they should be baptized a second time. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
was possible, therefore, for them to receive baptism, and either
not to receive remission of their sins, or to be burdened again
at once with the load of sins which were forgiven them; and
so the same is the case also with the heretics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. iv.</span>&mdash;6. Victor of Gor<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> said: "Seeing that sins are
forgiven only in the baptism of the Church, he who admits
heretics to communion without baptism is guilty of two errors
contrary to reason; for, on the one hand, he does not cleanse
the heretics, and, on the other, he defiles the Christians."</p>

<p>7. To this we answer that the baptism of the Church exists
even among heretics, though they themselves are not within
the Church; just as the water of Paradise was found in the
land of Egypt, though that land was not itself in Paradise.
We do not therefore admit heretics to communion without baptism;
and since they come with their waywardness corrected, we
receive not their sins, but the sacraments of Christ. And, in
respect of the remission of their sins, we say again here exactly
what we said above. And certainly, in regard of what he says
at the end of his judgment, declaring that he "is guilty of two
errors contrary to reason, seeing that on the one hand he does
not cleanse the heretics, and on the other he defiles the
Christians," Cyprian himself is the first and the most earnest
in repudiating this with the colleagues who agreed with him.
For neither did he think that he was defiled, when, on account
of the bond of peace, he decreed that it was right to hold communion
with such men, when he used the words, "Judging
no one, nor removing any from the right of communion if he
entertain a different opinion." Or, if heretics defile the
Church by being admitted to communion without being baptized,
then the whole Church has been defiled in virtue of
that custom which has been so often recorded here. And
just as those men call us <i>traditors</i> because of our forefathers,
in whom they were able to prove nothing of the sort when
they laid the charge against them, so, if every man partakes
of the character of those with whom he may have held communion,
all were then made heretics. And if every one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
asserts this is mad, it must be false that Victor says, when he
declares that "he who admits heretics to communion without
baptism, not only fails to cleanse the heretics, but pollutes
the Christians as well." Or if this be true, they were then
not admitted without baptism, but those men had the baptism
of Christ, although it was given and received among heretics,
who were so admitted in accordance with that custom which
these very men acknowledged to exist; and on the same
grounds they are even now rightly admitted in the same
manner.</p>

men,<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> what else does he do but make himself partaker with
the sins of other men, who holds communion with heretics
without the baptism of the Church? And therefore I pronounce
my judgment that heretics should be baptized, that
they may receive remission of their sins, and so communion
be allowed to them."</p>

<p>9. The answer is: Therefore Cyprian and all those bishops
were partakers in the sins of other men, inasmuch as they
remained in communion with such men, when they removed
no one from the right of communion who entertained a different
opinion. Where, then, is the Church? Then, to say
nothing for the moment of heretics,&mdash;since the words of this
judgment are applicable also to other sinners, such as Cyprian
saw with lamentation to be in the Church with him, whom,
while he confuted them, he yet tolerated,&mdash;where is the
Church, which, according to these words, must be held to
have perished from that very moment by the contagion of
their sins? But if, as is the most firmly established truth,
the Church both has remained and does remain, the partaking
of the sins of others, which is forbidden by the apostle,
must be considered only to consist in consenting to them.
But let heretics be baptized again, that they may receive
remission of their sins, if the wayward and the envious are
baptized again, who, seeing that they renounced the world in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
words and not in deeds, were indeed able to receive baptism,
but did not obtain remission of their sins, as the Lord says,

<p>11. To him we answer, that none of our party approves
the baptism of heretics, but all the baptism of Christ, even
though it be found in heretics who are as it were chaff outside
the Church, as it may be found in other unrighteous men
who are as chaff within the Church. For if those who are
baptized without the Church are not washed, but defiled,
assuredly those who are baptized outside the rock on which
the Church is built are not washed, but defiled. But all are
without the said rock who hear the words of Christ and do
them not. Or if it be the case that they are washed indeed
in baptism, but yet continue in the defilement of their unrighteousness,
from which they were unwilling to be changed

who says that authority is given to heretics also to baptize,
the same makes two baptisms."</p>

<p>27. To him we answer: Why does not he also make two
baptisms who maintains that the unrighteous also can baptize?
For although the righteous and unrighteous are in
themselves opposed to one another, yet the baptism which the
righteous give, such as was Paul, or such as was also Cyprian,
is not contrary to the baptism which those unrighteous men
were wont to give who hated Paul, whom Cyprian understands
to have been not heretics, but bad Catholics; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
although the moderation which was found in Cyprian, and
the covetousness which was found in his colleagues, are in
themselves opposed to one another, yet the baptism which
Cyprian used to give was not contrary to the baptism which
his colleagues who opposed him used to give, but one and the
same with it, because in both cases it is He that baptizes of

<p>29. To him we answer: We say that heretics have no
authority to baptize in the same sense in which we say that
defrauders have no authority to baptize. For not only to the
heretic, but to the sinner, God says, "What hast thou to do
to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my statutes
in thy mouth?" To the same person He assuredly says,

How much worse, therefore, are those who did not consent
with thieves, but themselves were wont to plunder farms with
treacherous deceits? Yet Cyprian did not consent with them,
though he did tolerate them in the corn-field of the Catholic
Church, lest the wheat should be rooted out together with it.
And yet at the same time the baptism which they themselves
conferred was the very selfsame baptism, because it was not
of them, but of Christ. As therefore they, although the baptism
of Christ be recognised in them, were yet not excused
and defended in doing unlawful things, and Christ rightly
called those His adversaries who were destined, by persevering
in such things, to hear the doom, "Depart from me,
ye that work iniquity,"<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> whence also they are called antichrists,

maintain or vindicate the priesthood of God, who do not baptize
the enemies of God, and hold communion with them
while they are thus unbaptized?"</p>

<p>31. The answer is this: Truly when such terms as this
are used, all moderation is passed; nor do they take into
consideration that even they themselves hold communion with
such men, "judging no one, nor removing any from the right
of communion if he entertain a contrary opinion." But
Saturninus has used an argument in this very judgment of
his, which might furnish materials for his admonition (if he
would pay attention to it), that in each man what is wrong
should be corrected, and what is right should be approved,
since he says, "The Gentiles, although they worship idols, yet
acknowledge and confess the supreme God, the Father and
Creator." If, then, any Gentile of such a kind should come to
God, would he wish to correct and change this point in him
that he acknowledged and confessed God the Father and
Creator? I trow not. But he would amend in him his
idolatry, which was an evil in him; and he would give to
him the sacraments of Christ, which he did not possess; and
anything that was wayward which he found in him he would
correct; and anything which had been wanting he would
supply. So also in the Marcionist heretic he would acknowledge
the perfectness of baptism, he would correct his waywardness,
he would teach him Catholic truth.</p>

are remitted only in the baptism of the Church, he who does
not baptize a heretic holds communion with a sinner."</p>

<p>33. What, does he who holds communion with one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
does this not hold communion with a sinner? But what
else did all of them do, in judging no one, or removing from
the right of communion any one who entertained a different
opinion? Where, then, is the Church? Are those things
not an obstacle to those who are patient, and tolerate the
tares lest the wheat should be rooted out together with them?
I would have them therefore say, who have committed the
sacrilege of schism by separating themselves from the whole
world, how it comes that they have in their mouths the judgment
of Cyprian, while they do not have in their hearts the
patience of Cyprian. But to this Marcellus we have an
answer in what has been said above concerning baptism and
the remission of sins, explaining how there can be baptism in
a man although there be in him no remission of his sins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xviii.</span>&mdash;34. Iren√¶us of Ululi<a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> said: "If the Church
does not baptize a heretic, because it is said that he has been
baptized already, then heresy is the greater."</p>

<p>35. The answer is: On the same principle it might be said,
If therefore the Church does not baptize the covetous man,
because it is said that he has been baptized already, then
covetousness is the greater. But this is false, therefore the
other is also false.</p>

one Church, and one baptism that appertains thereto.
If there is any one who says that the grace of baptism exists
among heretics, he must first show and prove that the Church
exists with them."</p>

<p>37. To him we answer: If you say that the grace of baptism
is identical with baptism, then it exists among heretics;
but if baptism is the sacrament or outward sign of grace,
while the grace itself is the abolition of sins, then the grace
of baptism does not exist with heretics. But so there is one
baptism and one Church, just as there is one faith. As
therefore the good and bad, not having one hope, can yet
have one baptism, so those who have not one common Church
can have one common baptism.</p>

<p>39. The answer is: This may also be considered as the
expression of our judgment too, and this is just what has
been done in respect of this question of baptism. For after
that the truth had been more clearly revealed, error gave way
to truth, when that most wholesome custom was further confirmed
by the authority of a general Council. It is well,
however, that they so constantly bear in mind that it was
possible even for Peter, the chief of the apostles, to have been
at one time minded otherwise than the truth required; which
we believe, without any disrespect to Cyprian, to have been
the case with him, and that with all our love for Cyprian, for
it is not right that he should be loved with greater love than
Peter.</p>

of his sins, because he entertained hatred towards his
brother in his heart, was nevertheless not to be baptized
again when he dismissed that hatred from his heart, does

<p>47. To him our answer is: Is it true that because Christ

therefore the party of the devil, which is proved to be among

gives up and betrays the baptism of Christ to heretics, what
else can he be said to be but a Judas to the Bride of Christ?"</p>

<p>49. How great a condemnation have we here of all schismatics,
who have separated themselves by wicked sacrilege
from the inheritance of Christ dispersed throughout the whole
world, if Cyprian held communion with such as was the
traitor Judas, and yet was not defiled by them; or if he was
defiled, then were all made such as Judas; or if they were
not, then the evil deeds of those who went before do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
belong to those who came after, even though they were the
offspring of the same communion. Why, therefore, do they
cast in our teeth the <i>traditores</i>, against whom they did not
prove their charge, and do not cast in their own teeth Judas,
with whom Cyprian and his colleagues held communion?
Behold the Council in which these men are wont to boast!
We indeed say, that he who approves the baptism of Christ
even in heretics, does not betray to heretics the baptism of
Christ; just in the same way as he does not betray to murderers
the baptism of Christ who approves the baptism of Christ even
in murderers: but inasmuch as they profess to prescribe to us
from the decrees of this Council what opinions we ought to
hold, let them first assent to it themselves. See how therein
were compared to the traitor Judas, all who said that heretics,
although baptized in heresy, yet should not be baptized again.
Yet with such Cyprian was willing to hold communion, when
he said, "Judging no man, nor depriving any of the right of
communion if he entertain a contrary opinion." But that
there had been men of such a sort in former times within
the Church, is made clear by the sentence in which he says:
"But some one will say, What, then, shall be done with these
men who in times past were admitted into the Church without
baptism?"<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> That such had been the custom of the
Church, is testified again and again by the very men who
compose this Council. If, therefore, any one who does this
"can be said to be nothing else but a Judas to the Bride of
Christ," according to the terms in which the judgment of
Therapius is couched; but Judas, according to the teaching
of the gospel, was a traitor; then all those men held communion
with traitors who at that time uttered those very
judgments, and before they uttered them they all had become
traitors through that custom which at that time was retained
by the Church. All, therefore&mdash;that is to say, both we and
they themselves who were the offspring of that unity&mdash;are
traitors. But we defend ourselves in two ways: first, because
without prejudice to the right of unity, as Cyprian himself
declared in his opening speech, we do not assent to the
decrees of this Council in which this judgment was pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>nounced;
and secondly, because we hold that the wicked in
no way hurt the good in Catholic unity, until at the last the
chaff be separated from the wheat. But our opponents, inasmuch
as they both shelter themselves as it were under the
decrees of this Council, and maintain that the good perish as
by a kind of infection from communion with the wicked, have
no resource to save them from allowing both that the earlier
Christians, whose offspring they are, were traitors, inasmuch
as they are convicted by their own Council; and that the
deeds of those who went before them do reflect on them,
since they throw in our teeth the deeds of our ancestors.</p>

man, the sober and the drunken, the well-affectioned and the
murderer, why should it not also serve the Christian and the

<p>71. There is one baptism in the Catholic Church, in such
a sense that, when any have gone out from it, it does not become
two in those who go out, but remains one and the same.
What, therefore, is recognised in those who return, should
also be recognised in those who received it from men who
have separated themselves, since they did not lose it when

say, both that if anything has been set on foot or done among
the heretics, that it ought to be rescinded; and also, that they
who come out from among the heretics should be baptized in
the Church."</p>

<p>73. Let it therefore be pronounced of no effect that they
baptize, who hear the words of God and do them not, when
they shall begin to pass from unrighteousness to righteousness,
that is, from the sand to the rock. And if this is not
done, because what there was in them of Christ was not
violated by their unrighteousness, then let this also be understood
in the case of heretics: for neither is there the same
hope in the unrighteous, so long as they are on the sand, as
there is in those who are upon the rock; and yet there is
in both the same baptism, although as it is said that there is
one hope, so also is it said that there is one baptism.</p>

obtain the grace of baptism where it is lawfully given."</p>

<p>75. Our answer is: Let them indeed begin to have in a
lawful manner to salvation what they before had unlawfully
to destruction; because each man is justified under the same
baptism, when he has turned himself to God with a true

that baptism is not unto salvation except within the Catholic
Church. Whatsoever is without the Catholic Church is mere
pretence."</p>

<p>77. This indeed is true, that "baptism is not unto salvation
except within the Catholic Church." For in itself it can
indeed exist outside the Catholic Church as well; but there it
is not unto salvation, because there it does not work salvation;
just as that sweet savour of Christ is certainly not unto
salvation in them that perish,<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> though from a fault not in
itself, but in them. But "whatsoever is without the Catholic
Church is mere pretence," yet only in so far as it is not
Catholic. But there may be something Catholic outside the
Catholic Church, just as the name of Christ could exist outside
the congregation of Christ, in which name he who did
not follow with the disciples was casting out devils.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> For
there may be pretence also within the Catholic Church, as is
unquestionable in the case of those who renounce the world
in words and not in deeds, and yet the pretence is not Catholic.
As, therefore, there is in the Catholic Church something which
is not Catholic, so there may be something which is Catholic
outside the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>79. Our answer is: On this theory, the very men who
founded heresies are not heretics themselves, because they
separated themselves from the Church, and certainly they
previously had what they received there. But if it is absurd
to say that those are not heretics through whom the rest became

also know, I have not been long appointed a bishop,
and therefore I waited for the counsel of my seniors. This
therefore I express as my opinion, that whosoever comes from
heresy should undoubtedly be baptized."</p>

<p>83. What, therefore, has been answered to those for whom
he waited, may be taken as the answer also to himself.</p>

of our Lord Jesus Christ is manifest, when He sent forth His
apostles, and gave the power which had been given Him of
His Father to them alone, whose successors we are, governing
the Church of the Lord with the same power, and baptizing
those who believe the faith. And therefore heretics, who,
being without, have neither power nor the Church of Christ,
cannot baptize any one with His baptism."</p>

<p>85. Are, then, ill-affectioned murderers successors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
apostles? Why, then, do they baptize? Is it because they
are not outside? But they are outside the rock, to which
the Lord gave the keys, and on which He said that He
would build His Church.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xliv.</span>&mdash;86. Secundianus of Thambei<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> said: "We
ought not to deceive heretics by our too great forwardness,
that not having been baptized in the Church of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and having therefore not received remission
of their sins, they may not impute to us, when the day
of judgment comes, that we have been the cause of their
not being baptized, and not having obtained the indulgence
of the grace of God. On which account, since there is one
Church and one baptism, when they are converted to us, let
them receive together with the Church the baptism also of
the Church."</p>

<p>87. Nay, when they are transferred to the rock, and joined
to the society of the Dove, let them receive the remission of
their sins, which they could not have outside the rock and
outside the Dove, whether they were openly without, like the
heretics, or apparently within, like the abandoned Catholics;
of whom, however, it is clear that they both have and confer
baptism without remission of sins, when even from themselves
it is received by men, who, being not changed for the better,
honour God with their lips, while their heart is far from
Him.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> Yet it is true that there is one baptism, just as there
is one Dove, though those who are not in the one communion
of the Dove may yet have baptism in common.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xlv.</span>&mdash;88. Also another Aurelius of Chullabi<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> said:
"The Apostle John has laid down in his epistle the following
precept: 'If there come any unto you, and bring not this
doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him
God speed: for he that biddeth him God speed is partaker
of his evil deeds.'<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> How can such men be admitted without
consideration into the house of God, who are forbidden to be
admitted into our private house? Or how can we hold com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>munion
with them without the baptism of Christ, when, if we
only so much as bid them God speed, we are partakers of
their evil deeds?"</p>

<p>89. In respect of this testimony of John there is no need
of further disputation, since it has no reference at all to the
question of baptism, which we are at present discussing. For
he says, "If any come unto you, and bring not the doctrine of
Christ." But heretics leaving the doctrine of their error are
converted to the doctrine of Christ, that they may be incorporated
with the Church, and may begin to belong to the
members of that Dove whose sacrament they previously had;
and therefore what previously they lacked belonging to it is
given to them, that is to say, peace and charity out of a pure
heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> But
what they previously had belonging to the Dove is acknowledged,
and received without any depreciation; just as in the
adulteress God recognises His gifts, even when she is following
her lovers; because when after her fornication is corrected
she is turned again to chastity, those gifts are not laid to her
charge, but she herself is corrected.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> But just as Cyprian
might have defended himself, if this testimony of John had
been cast in his teeth, whilst he was holding communion
with men like these, so let those against whom it is spoken
make their own defence. For to the question before us, as
I said before, it has no reference at all. For John says that
we are not to bid God speed to men of strange doctrine; but
Paul the apostle says, with even greater vehemence, "If any
man that is called a brother be covetous, or a drunkard," or
anything of the sort, with such an one no not to eat;<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> and
yet Cyprian used to admit to fellowship, not with his private
table, but with the altar of God, his colleagues who were
usurers, and treacherous, and fraudulent, and robbers. But
in what manner this may be defended has been sufficiently
set forth in other books already.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xlvi.</span>&mdash;90. Litteus of Gemelli<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> said: "'If the blind
lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.'<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> Since, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>fore,
it is clear that heretics can give no light<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> to any one, as
being blind themselves, therefore their baptism is invalid."</p>

<p>91. Neither do we say that it is valid for salvation so long
as they are heretics, just as it is of no value to those murderers
of whom we spoke so long as they hate their brethren:
for they also themselves are in darkness, and if any one
follows them they fall together into the ditch; and yet it
does not follow that they either have not baptism or are
unable to confer it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xlvii.</span>&mdash;92. Natalis of Oea<a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> said: "It is not only I
myself who am present, but also Pompeius of Sabrata,<a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> and
Dioga of Leptis Magna,<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> who commissioned me to represent
their views, being absent indeed in body, but present in spirit,
who deliver this same judgment as our colleagues, that heretics
cannot have communion with us, unless they have been baptized
with the baptism of the Church."</p>

<p>93. He means, I suppose, that communion which belongs
to the society of the Dove; for in the partaking of the sacraments
they doubtless held communion with them, judging no
man, nor removing any from the right of communion if he
held a different opinion. But with whatever reference he
spoke, there is no great need for these words being refuted.
For certainly a heretic would not be admitted to communion,
unless he had been baptized with the baptism of the Church.
But it is clear that the baptism of the Church exists even
among heretics if it be consecrated with the words of the
gospel; just as the gospel itself belongs to the Church, and
has nothing to do with their waywardness, but certainly
retains its own holiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xlviii.</span>&mdash;94. Junius of Neapolis<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> said: "I do
not depart from the judgment which we once pronounced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
that we should baptize heretics on their coming to the
Church."</p>

<p>95. Since this man has adduced no argument nor proof
from the Scriptures, he need not detain us long.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xlix.</span>&mdash;96. Cyprian of Carthage said: "My opinion
has been set forth with the greatest fulness in the letter
which has been written to our colleague Jubaianus,<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> that
heretics being called enemies of Christ and antichrists according
to the testimony of the gospel and the apostles, should,
when they come to the Church, be baptized with the one
baptism of the Church, that from enemies they may be
made friends, and that from antichrists they may be made
Christians."</p>

<p>97. What need is there of further disputation here, seeing
that we have already handled with the utmost care that very
epistle to Jubaianus of which he has made mention? And
as to what he has said here, let us not forget that it might be
said of all unrighteous men who, as he himself bears witness,
are in the Catholic Church, and whose power of possessing
and of conferring baptism is not questioned by any of us.
For they come to the Church, who pass to Christ from the
party of the devil, and build upon the rock, and are incorporated
with the Dove, and are placed in security in the garden
enclosed and fountain sealed; where none of those are found
who live contrary to the precepts of Christ, wherever they may
seem to be. For in the epistle which he wrote to Magnus,
while discussing this very question, he himself warned us at
sufficient length, and in no ambiguous terms, of what kind of
society we should understand that the Church consists. For
he says, in speaking of a certain man, "Let him become an
alien and profane, an enemy to the peace and unity of the
Lord, not dwelling in the house of God, that is to say, in the
Church of Christ, in which none dwell save those who are of
one heart and of one mind."<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> Let those, therefore, who would
lay injunctions on us on the authority of Cyprian, pay attention
for a time to what we here say. For if only those who
are of one heart and of one mind dwell in the Church of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Christ, beyond all question those were not dwelling in the
Church of Christ, however much they might appear to be
within, who of envy and contention were announcing Christ
without charity; by whom he understands, not the heretics
and schismatics who are mentioned by the Apostle Paul,<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> but
false brethren holding conversation with him within, who
certainly ought not to have baptized, because they were not
dwelling in the Church, in which he himself says that none
dwell save those who are of one heart and of one mind: unless,
indeed, any one be so far removed from the truth as to say
that those were of one heart and of one mind who were
envious and malevolent, and contentious without charity; and
yet they used to baptize: nor did the detestable waywardness
which they displayed in any degree violate or diminish from the
sacrament of Christ, which was handled and dispensed by them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. l.</span>&mdash;98. It is indeed worth while to consider the
whole of the passage in the aforesaid letter to Magnus, which
he has put together as follows: "Not dwelling," he says, "in
the house of God&mdash;that is to say, in the Church of Christ&mdash;in
which none dwell save those that are of one heart and of one
mind, as the Holy Spirit says in the Psalms, speaking of 'God
that maketh men to be of one mind in an house.'<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> Finally,
the very sacrifices of the Lord declare that Christians are
united among themselves by a firm and inseparable love for
one another. For when the Lord calls bread, which is compacted
together by the union of many grains, His body,<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> He
is signifying one people, whom He bore, compacted into one
body; and when He calls wine, which is pressed out from a
multitude of branches and clusters and brought together into
one, His blood,<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> He also signifies one flock joined together by
the mingling of a multitude united into one." These words
of the blessed Cyprian show that he both understood and
loved the glory of the house of God, which house he asserted
to consist of those who are of one heart and of one mind,
proving it by the testimony of the prophets and the meaning
of the sacraments, and in which house certainly were not found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
those envious persons, those malevolent without charity, who
nevertheless used to baptize. From whence it is clear that
the sacrament of Christ can both be in and be administered by
those who are not in the Church of Christ, in which Cyprian
himself bears witness that there are none dwelling save those
who are of one heart and of one mind. Nor can it indeed be
said that they are allowed to baptize so long as they are undetected,
seeing that the Apostle Paul did not fail to detect
those of whose ministry he bears unquestionable testimony in
his epistle, saying that he rejoices that they also were proclaiming
Christ. For he says of them, "Whether in pretence
or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea,
and will rejoice."<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. li.</span>&mdash;99. Taking all these things, therefore, into consideration,
I think that I am not rash in saying that there are
some in the house of God after such a fashion as not to be
themselves the very house of God, which is said to be built
upon a rock,<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> which is called the one dove,<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> which is styled

of pomegranates with pleasant fruits,<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> which house also received

Thee;"<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> with countless other passages to the same effect. This
house is also called wheat, bringing forth fruit with patience,
some thirty-fold, some sixty-fold, and some an hundred-fold.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
This house is also in vessels of gold and of silver,<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> and in
precious stones and imperishable woods. To this house it is
said, "Forbearing one another in love, endeavouring to keep
the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;"<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> and, "For the

is composed of those that are good and faithful, and of the
holy servants of God dispersed throughout the world, and
bound together by the unity of the Spirit, whether they know
each other personally or not. But we hold that others are
said to be in the house after such a sort, that they belong
not to the substance of the house, nor to the society of fruitful
and peaceful justice, but only as the chaff is said to be
among the corn; for that they are in the house we cannot
deny, when the apostle says, "But in a great house there are
not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of
earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour."<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> Of this
countless multitude are found to be not only the crowd which
within the Church afflicts the heart of the saints, who are so
few in comparison with so vast a host, but also the heresies
and schisms which exist in those who have burst the meshes of
the net, and may now be said to be rather out of the house
than in the house, of whom it is said, "They went out from
us, but they were not of us."<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> For they are more thoroughly
separated, now that they are also divided from us in the body,
than are those who live within the Church in a carnal and
worldly fashion, and are separated from us in the spirit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. lii.</span>&mdash;100. Of all these several classes, then, no one
doubts respecting those first, who are in the house of God in
such a sense as themselves to be the house of God, whether
they be already spiritual, or as yet only babes nurtured with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
milk, but still making progress, with earnestness of heart,
towards that which is spiritual, that such men both have
baptism so as to be of profit to themselves, and transmit it to
those who follow their example so as to benefit them; but
that in its transmission to those who are false, whom the
Holy Spirit shuns, though they themselves, so far as lies with
them, confer it so as to be of profit, yet the others receive it
in vain, since they do not imitate those from whom they
receive it. But they who are in the great house after the
fashion of vessels to dishonour, both have baptism without
profit to themselves, and transmit it without profit to those
who follow their example: those, however, receive it with
profit, who are united in heart and character, not to their
ministers, but to the holy house of God. But those who are
more thoroughly separated, so as to be rather out of the house
than in the house, have baptism without any profit to themselves;
and, moreover, there is no profit to those who receive
it from them, unless they be compelled by urgent necessity
to receive it, and their heart in receiving it does not depart
from the bond of unity: yet nevertheless they possess it,
though the possession be of no avail; and it is received from
them, even when it is of no profit to those who so receive it,
though, in order that it may become of use, they must depart
from their heresy or schism, and cleave to that house of God.
And this ought to be done, not only by heretics and schismatics,
but also by those who are in the house through communion
in the sacraments, yet so as to be outside the house
through the perversity of their character. For so the sacrament
begins to be of profit even to themselves, which previously was
of no avail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. LIII.</span>&mdash;101. The question is also commonly raised,
whether baptism is to be held valid which is received from
one who had not himself received it, if, from some promptings
of curiosity, he had chanced to learn how it ought to be conferred;
and whether it makes no difference in what spirit the
recipient receives it, whether in mockery or in sincerity: if
in mockery, whether the difference arises when the mockery
is of deceit, as in the Church, or in what is thought to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
Church; or when it is in jest, as in a play: and which is the
more accursed, to receive it deceitfully in the Church, or in
heresy or schism without deceit, that is to say, with full sincerity
of heart; or whether it be worse to receive it deceitfully
in heresy or in good faith in a play, if any one were to
be moved by a sudden feeling of religion in the midst of his
acting. And yet, if we compare such an one even with him
who receives it deceitfully in the Catholic Church itself, I
should be surprised if any one were to doubt which of the
two should be preferred; for I do not see of what avail the
intention of him who gives in truth can be to him who
receives deceitfully. But let us consider, in the case of some
one also giving it in deceit, when both the giver and the recipient
are acting deceitfully in the unity of the Catholic Church
itself, whether this should rather be acknowledged as baptism,
or that which is given in a play, if any one should be found
who received it faithfully from a sudden impulse of religion:
or whether it be not true that, so far as the men themselves
are concerned, there is a very great difference between the believing
recipient in a play, and the mocking recipient in the
Church; but that in regard to the genuineness of the sacrament
there is no difference. For if it makes no difference in respect
to the genuineness of the sacrament within the Catholic Church
itself, whether certain persons celebrate it in truth or in deceit,
so long as both still celebrate the same thing, I cannot see
why it should make a difference outside, seeing that he who
receives it is not cloaked by his deceit, but he is changed by
his religious impulse. Or have those truthful persons among
whom it is celebrated more power for the confirmation of the
sacrament, than those deceitful men by whom and in whom it
is celebrated can exert for its invalidation? And yet, if the
deceit be subsequently brought to light, no one seeks a repetition
of the sacrament; but the fraud is either punished by
excommunication or set right by penitence.</p>

<p>102. But the safe course for us is, not to advance with any
rashness of judgment in setting forth a view which has neither
been started in any provincial Council of the Catholic Church
nor established in a general one; but to assert, with all the
confidence of a voice that cannot be gainsaid, what has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
confirmed by the consent of the universal Church, under the
direction of our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ. Nevertheless,
if any one were to press me&mdash;supposing I were duly
seated in a Council in which a question were raised on points
like these&mdash;to declare what my own opinion was, without reference
to the previously expressed views of others, whose judgment
I would rather follow, if I were under the influence of
the same feelings as led me to assert what I have said before,
I should have no hesitation in saying that all men possess baptism
who have received it in any place, from any sort of men,
provided that it were consecrated in the words of the gospel,
and received without deceit on their part with some degree of
faith; although it would be of no profit to them for the salvation
of their souls if they were without charity, by which they
might be grafted into the Catholic Church. For "though I
have faith," says the apostle, "so that I could remove mountains,
but have not charity, I am nothing."<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> Just as already,
from the established decrees of our predecessors, I have no
hesitation in saying that all those have baptism who, though
they receive it deceitfully, yet receive it in the Church, or
where the Church is thought to be by those in whose society
it is received, of whom it was said, "They went out from us."<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>
But when there was no society of those who so believed, and
when the man who received it did not himself hold such
belief, but the whole thing was done as a farce, or a comedy,
or a jest,&mdash;if I were asked whether the baptism which was
thus conferred should be approved, I should declare my opinion
that we ought to pray for the declaration of God's judgment
through the medium of some revelation, seeking it with united
prayer and earnest groanings of suppliant devotion, humbly
deferring all the time to the decision of those who were to
give their judgment after me, in case they should set forth
anything as already known and determined. And, therefore,
how much the more must I be considered to have given my
opinion now without prejudice to the utterance of more diligent
research or authority higher than my own!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. LIV.</span>&mdash;103. But now I think that it is fully time for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
me to bring to their due termination these books also on the
subject of baptism, in which our Lord God has shown to us,
through the words of the peaceful Bishop Cyprian and his
brethren who agreed with him, how great is the love which
should be felt for catholic unity; so that even where they were
otherwise minded until God should reveal even this to them,<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>
they should rather bear with those who thought differently
from themselves, than sever themselves from them by a wicked
schism; whereby the mouths of the Donatists are wholly
closed, even if we say nothing of the followers of Maximian.
For if the wicked pollute the good in unity, then even Cyprian
himself already found no Church to which he could be joined.
But if the wicked do not infect the good in unity, then the
sacrilegious Donatist has no ground to set before himself for
separation. But if baptism is both possessed and transferred
by the multitude of others who work the works of the flesh,
of which it is said, that "they which do such things shall not
inherit the kingdom of God,"<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> then it is possessed and transferred
also by heretics, who are numbered among those works;
because they could have transferred it had they remained, and
did not lose it by their secession. But men of this kind
confer it on their fellows as fruitlessly and uselessly as the
others who resemble them, inasmuch as they shall not inherit
the kingdom of God. And as, when those others are brought
into the right path, it is not that baptism begins to be present,
having been absent before, but that it begins to profit them,
having been already in them; so is it the case with heretics
as well. Whence Cyprian and those who thought with him
could not impose limits on the Catholic Church, which they
would not mutilate. But in that they were otherwise minded
we feel no fear, seeing that we too share in their veneration
for Peter; yet in that they did not depart from unity we
rejoice, seeing that we, like them, are founded on the rock.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Augustine, to the well-beloved brethren that belong to the care of

<p class="cap">CHAP. I.&mdash;1. Ye know that we have often wished to bring
forward into open notoriety, and to confute, not so
much from our own arguments as from theirs, the sacrilegious
error of the Donatist heretics; whence it came to pass that
we wrote letters even to some of their leaders,&mdash;not indeed
for purposes of communion with them, for of that they had
already in times past rendered themselves unworthy by dissenting
from the Church; nor yet in terms of reproach, but
of a conciliatory character, with the view that, having discussed
the question with us which caused them to break off
from the holy communion of the whole world, they might, on
consideration of the truth, be willing to be corrected, and
might not defend the headstrong perversity of their predecessors
with a yet more foolish obstinacy, but might be reunited
to the Catholic stock, so as to bring forth the fruits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
charity. But as it is written, "I am for peace, but when I
speak they are for war,"<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> so they rejected my letters, just as
they hate the very name of peace, in whose interests they
were written. Now, however, as I was in the church of
Constantina, Absentius being present, with my colleague
Fortunatus, his bishop, the brethren brought before my
notice a letter, which they said that a bishop of the said
schism had addressed to his presbyters, as was set forth in
the superscription of the letter itself. When I had read it, I
was so amazed to find that in his very first words he cut
away the very roots of the whole claims of his party to communion,
that I was unwilling to believe that it could be the
letter of a man who, if fame speaks truly, is especially conspicuous
among them for learning and eloquence. But some
of those who were present when I read it, being acquainted
with the style and character of his composition, gradually
persuaded me that it was undoubtedly his address. I thought,
however, that whoever the author might be, it required refutation,
lest the writer should seem to himself, in the company
of the inexperienced, to have written something of weight
against the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>2. The first point, then, that he lays down in his letter is
the statement, "that we find fault with them for the repetition
of baptism, while we ourselves pollute our souls with a
laver stained with guilt." But to what profit is it that I
should reproduce all his insulting terms? For, since it is
one thing to strengthen proofs, another thing to meddle with
abusive words by way of refutation, let us rather turn our
attention to the mode in which he has sought to prove that
we do not possess baptism, and that therefore they do not
require the repetition of what was already present, but confer
what hitherto was wanting. For he says: "What we look
for is the conscience of the giver to cleanse that of the recipient."
But supposing the conscience of the giver is concealed
from view, and perhaps defiled with sin, how will it be
able to cleanse the conscience of the recipient, if, as he says,
"what we look for is the conscience of the giver to cleanse
that of the recipient?" For if he should say that it makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
no matter to the recipient what amount of evil may lie concealed
from view in the conscience of the giver, perhaps that
ignorance may have such a degree of efficacy as this, that a
man cannot be defiled by the guilt of the conscience of him
from whom he receives baptism, so long as he is unaware of
it. Let it then be granted that the guilty conscience of his
neighbour cannot defile a man so long as he is unaware of it,
but is it therefore clear that it can further cleanse him from
his own guilt?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ii.</span>&mdash;3. Whence, then, is a man to be cleansed who
receives baptism, when the conscience of the giver is polluted
without the knowledge of him who is to receive it? Especially
when he goes on to say, "For he who receives faith
from the faithless receives not faith, but guilt." There stands
before us one that is faithless ready to baptize, and he who
should be baptized is ignorant of his faithlessness: what think
you that he will receive? Faith, or guilt? If you answer
faith, then you will grant that it is possible that a man should
receive not guilt, but faith, from him that is faithless; and the
former saying will be false, that "he who receives faith from
the faithless receives not faith, but guilt." For we find that
it is possible that a man should receive faith even from one
that is faithless, if he be not aware of the faithlessness of the
giver. For he does not say, He who receives faith from one
that is openly and notoriously faithless; but he says, "He who
receives faith from the faithless receives not faith, but guilt;"
which certainly is false when a person is baptized by one who
hides his faithlessness. But if he shall say, Even when the
faithlessness of the baptizer is concealed, the recipient receives
not faith from him, but guilt, then let them rebaptize those
who are well known to have been baptized by men who in
their own body have long concealed a life of guilt, but have
eventually been detected, convicted, and condemned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. iii.</span>&mdash;For, so long as they escaped detection, they
could not bestow faith on any whom they baptized, but only
guilt, if it be true that whosoever receives faith from one that
is faithless receives not faith, but guilt. Let them therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
be baptized by the good, that they may be enabled to receive
not guilt, but faith.</p>

<p>4. But how, again, shall they have any certainty about the
good who are to give them faith, if what we look to is the
conscience of the giver, which is unseen by the eyes of the proposed
recipient? Therefore, according to their judgment, the
salvation of the spirit is made uncertain, so long as in opposition
to the holy Scriptures, which say, "It is better to trust
in the Lord than to put confidence in man,"<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> and, "Cursed be
the man that trusteth in man,"<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> they remove the hope of
those who are to be baptized from the Lord their God, and
persuade them that it should be placed in man; the practical
result of which is, that their salvation becomes not merely
uncertain, but actually null and void. For "salvation belongeth
unto the Lord,"<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> and "vain is the help of man."<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>
Therefore, whosoever places his trust in man, even in one
whom he knows to be just and innocent, is accursed. Whence
also the Apostle Paul finds fault with those who said they
were of Paul, saying, "Was Paul crucified for you? or were
ye baptized in the name of Paul?"<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. iv.</span>&mdash;5. Wherefore, if they were in error, and would
have perished had they not been corrected, who wished to be
of Paul, what must we suppose to be the hope of those who
wished to be of Donatus? For they use their utmost endeavours
to prove that the origin, root, and head of the
baptized person is none other than the individual by whom
he is baptized. The result is, that since it is very often a
matter of uncertainty what kind of man the baptizer is, the
hope therefore of the baptized being of uncertain origin, of
uncertain root, of uncertain head, is of itself uncertain altogether.
And since it is possible that the conscience of the
giver may be in such a condition as to be accursed and defiled
without the knowledge of the recipient, it results that,
being of an accursed origin, accursed root, accursed head, the
hope of the baptized may prove to be vain and ungrounded.
For Petilian expressly states in his epistle, that "everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
consists of an origin and root; and if it have not something
for a head, it is nothing." And since by the origin and root
and head of the baptized person he wishes to be understood
the man by whom he is baptized, what good does the unhappy
recipient derive from the fact that he does not know how
bad a man his baptizer really is? For he does not know that
he himself has a bad head, or actually no head at all. And
yet what hope can a man have, who, whether he is aware of
it or not, has either a very bad head or no head at all? Can
we maintain that his very ignorance forms a head, when his
baptizer is either a bad head or none at all? Surely any one
who thinks this is unmistakeably without a head.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. v.</span>&mdash;6. We ask, therefore, since he says, "He who
receives faith from the faithless receives not faith, but guilt,"
and immediately adds to this the further statement, that
"everything consists of an origin and root; and if it have not
something for a head, it is nothing;"&mdash;we ask, I say, in a case
where the faithlessness of the baptizer is undetected: If, then,
the man whom he baptizes receives faith, and not guilt; if,
then, the baptizer is not his origin and root and head, who is it
from whom he receives faith? where is the origin from which
he springs? where is the root of which he is a shoot? where
the head which is his starting-point? Can it be, that when
he who is baptized is unaware of the faithlessness of his
baptizer, it is then Christ who is the origin and root and head?
Alas for human rashness and conceit! Why do you not allow
that it is always Christ who gives faith, for the purpose of
making a man a Christian by giving it? Why do you not
allow that Christ is always the origin of the Christian, that
the Christian always plants his root in Christ, that Christ is
the head of the Christian? Do we then maintain that, even
when spiritual grace is dispensed to those that believe by the
hands of a holy and faithful minister, it is still not the
minister himself who justifies, but that One of whom it is
said, that "He justifieth the ungodly?"<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> But unless we admit
this, either the Apostle Paul was the head and origin of
those whom he had planted, or Apollos the root of those whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
he had watered, rather than He who had given them faith in
believing; whereas the same Paul says, "I have planted,
Apollos watered, but God gave the increase: so then neither
is he that planteth anything, nor he that watereth, but God
that giveth the increase."<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> Nor was the apostle himself their
root, but rather He who says, "I am the vine, ye are the
branches."<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> How, too, could he be their head, when he says,
that "we, being many, are one body in Christ,"<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> and expressly
declares in many passages that Christ Himself is the head of
the whole body?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>CHAP. VI.&mdash;7. Wherefore, whether a man receive the sacrament
of baptism from a faithful or a faithless minister, his
whole hope is in Christ, that he fall not under the condemnation
that "cursed is he that placeth his hope in man."
Otherwise, if each man is born again in spiritual grace of the
same sort as he by whom he is baptized, and if when he who
baptizes him is manifestly a good man, then he himself gives
faith, he is himself the origin and root and head of him who
is being born; whilst, when the baptizer is faithless without
its being known, then the baptized person receives faith from
Christ, then he derives his origin from Christ, then he is rooted
in Christ, then he boasts in Christ as his head,&mdash;in that case
all who are baptized should wish that they might have faithless
baptizers, and be ignorant of their faithlessness: for however
good their baptizers might have been, Christ is certainly
beyond comparison better still; and He will then be the head
of the baptized, if the faithlessness of the baptizer shall escape
detection.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. vii.</span>&mdash;8. But if it is perfect madness to hold such
a view (for it is Christ always that justifieth the ungodly, by
changing his ungodliness into Christianity; it is from Christ
always that faith is received, Christ is always the origin of
the regenerate and the head of the Church), what weight,
then, will those words have, which thoughtless readers value
by their sound, without inquiring what their inner meaning
is? For the man who does not content himself with hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
the words with his ear, but considers the meaning of the
phrase, when he hears, "What we look to is the conscience of
the giver, that it may cleanse the conscience of the recipient,"
will answer, The conscience of man is often unknown to me,
but I am certain of the mercy of Christ: when he hears, "He
who receives faith from the faithless receives not faith, but
guilt," will answer, Christ is not faithless, from whom I receive
not guilt, but faith: when he hears, "Everything consists of an
origin and root; and if it have not something for a head, is
nothing," will answer, My origin is Christ, my root is Christ,
my head is Christ. When he hears, "Nor does anything well
receive second birth, unless it be born again of good seed," he
will answer, The seed of which I am born again is the Word
of God, which I am warned to hear with attention, even
though he through whom I hear it does not himself do what
he preaches; according to the words of the Lord, which make
me herein safe, "All whatsoever they bid you observe, that
observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say,
and do not."<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> When he hears, "What perversity must it be,
that he who is guilty through his own sins should make
another free from guilt!" he will answer, No one makes me
free from guilt but He who died for our sins, and rose again
for our justification. For I believe, not in the minister by whose
hands I am baptized, but in Him who justifieth the ungodly,
that my faith may be counted unto me for righteousness.<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. viii.</span>&mdash;9. When he hears, "Every good tree bringeth
good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit: do men
gather grapes of thorns?"<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> and, "A good man out of the good
treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things, and an evil man
out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things;"<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> he will
answer, This therefore is good fruit, that I should be a good
tree, that is, a good man; that I should show forth good fruit,
that is, good works. But this will be given to me, not by
him that planteth, nor by him that watereth, but by God that
giveth the increase. For if the good tree be the good baptizer,
so that his good fruit should be the man whom he
baptizes, then any one who has been baptized by a bad man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
even if his wickedness be not manifest, will have no power to
be good, for he is sprung from an evil tree. For a good tree
is one thing; a tree whose quality is concealed, but yet bad,
is another. Or if, when the tree is bad, but hides its badness,
then whosoever is baptized by it is born not of it, but of
Christ; then they are justified with more perfect holiness
who are baptized by the bad who hide their evil nature, than
they who are baptized by the manifestly good.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ix.</span>&mdash;10. Again, when he hears, "He that is washed
by one dead, his washing profiteth him nought,"<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> he will
answer, "Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no more;
death hath no more dominion over Him:"<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> of whom it is said,
"The same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>
But they are baptized by the dead, who are baptized in the
temples of idols. For even they themselves do not suppose
that they receive the sanctification which they look for from
their priests, but from their gods; and since these were men,
and are dead in such sort as to be now neither upon earth nor
in the rest of heaven,<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> they are truly baptized by the dead:
and the same answer will hold good if there be any other way
in which these words of holy Scripture may be examined,
and profitably discussed and understood. For if in this place
I understand a baptizer who is a sinner, the same absurdity
will follow, that whosoever has been baptized by an ungodly
man, even though his ungodliness be undiscovered, is yet
washed in vain, as though baptized by one dead. For he does
not say, He that is baptized by one manifestly dead, but absolutely,
"by one dead." And if they consider any man to be
dead whom they know to be a sinner, but any one in their
communion to be alive, even though he manages most adroitly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
to conceal a life of wickedness, in the first place with
accursed pride they claim more for themselves than they
ascribe to God, that when a sinner is unveiled to them he
should be called dead, but when he is known by God he is
held to be alive. In the next place, if that sinner is to be
called dead who is known to be such by men, what answer
will they make about Optatus, whom they were afraid to condemn
though they had long known his wickedness? Why
are those who were baptized by him not said to have been
baptized by one dead? Did he live because faith was in his
company?<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>&mdash;an elegant and well-turned saying of some early
colleagues of their own, which they themselves are wont to quote
with pride, not understanding that at the death of the haughty
Goliath it was his own sword by which his head was cut off.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. x.</span>&mdash;11. Lastly, if they are willing to give the name
of dead neither to the wicked man whose sin is hidden, nor
to him whose sin is manifest, but who has yet not been condemned
by them, but only to him whose sin is manifest and
condemned, so that whosoever is baptized by him is himself
baptized by the dead, and his washing profits him nothing;
what are we to say of those whom their own party have condemned
"by the unimpeachable voice of a general Council,"<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>
together with Maximianus and the others who ordained him,&mdash;I
mean Felicianus of Musti, and Pr√¶textatus of Assura, of whom
I speak in the meantime, who are counted among the twelve
ordainers of Maximianus, as erecting an altar in opposition to
their altar at which Primianus stands? They at any rate
are reckoned by them among the dead. To this we have the
express testimony of the noble decree of that Council of theirs
which formerly called forth shouts of unreserved<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> applause
when it was recited among them for the purpose of being
decreed, but which would now be received in silence if we
should chance to recite it in their ears; whereas they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
rather have been slow at first to rejoice in its eloquence, lest
they should afterwards come to mourn over it when its credit
was destroyed. For in it they speak in the following terms
of the followers of Maximianus, who were shut out from their
communion: "Seeing that the shipwrecked members of certain
men have been dashed by the waves of truth upon the
sharp rocks, and after the fashion of the Egyptians, the
shores are covered with the bodies of the dying; whose
punishment is intensified in death itself, since after their life
has been wrung from them by the avenging waters, they fail
to find so much as burial." In such gross terms, indeed, do
they insult those who were guilty of schism from their body,
that they call them dead and unburied; but certainly they
ought to have wished that they might obtain burial, if it were
only that they might not have seen Optatus Gildonianus advancing
with a military force, and like a sweeping wave that
dashes beyond its fellows, sucking back Felicianus and Pr√¶textatus
once again within their pale, out of the multitude of
bodies lying unburied on the shore.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xi.</span>&mdash;12. Of these I would ask, whether by coming
to their sea they were restored to life, or whether they are
still dead there? For if still they are none the less corpses,
then the laver cannot in any way profit those who are baptized
by such dead men. But if they have been restored to
life, yet how can the laver profit those whom they baptized
before outside, while they were lying without life, if the
passage, "He who is baptized by the dead, of what profit is
his baptism to him," is to be understood in the way in
which they think? For those whom Pr√¶textatus and Felicianus
baptized while they were yet in communion with
Maximianus are now retained among them, sharing in their
communion, without being again baptized, together with the
same men who baptized them&mdash;I mean Felicianus and Pr√¶textatus:
taking occasion by which fact, if it were not that
they cherish the beginning of their own obstinacy, instead of
considering the certain end of their spiritual salvation, they
would certainly be bound to vigilance, and ought to recover
the soundness of their senses, so as to breathe again in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Catholic peace; if only, laying aside the swelling of their
pride, and overcoming the madness of their stubbornness,
they would take heed and see what monstrous sacrilege it is
to curse the baptism of the foreign churches, which we have
learned from the sacred books were planted in primitive
times, and to receive the baptism of the followers of Maximianus,
whom they have condemned with their own lips.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xii.</span>&mdash;13. But our brethren themselves, the sons of
the aforesaid churches, were both ignorant at the time, and
still are ignorant, of what has been done so many years ago
in Africa: wherefore they at any rate cannot be defiled by
the charges which have been brought, on the part of the
Donatists, against the Africans, without even knowing
whether they were true. But the Donatists having openly
separated and divided themselves off, although they are even
said to have taken part in the ordination of Primianus, yet
condemned the said Primianus, ordained another bishop in
opposition to Primianus, baptized outside the communion of
Primianus, rebaptized after Primianus, and returned to Primianus
with their disciples who had been baptized by themselves
outside, and never rebaptized by any one inside. If
such a union with the party of Maximianus does not pollute
the Donatists, how can the mere report concerning the
Africans pollute the foreigners? If the lips meet together
without offence in the kiss of peace, which reciprocally condemned
each other, why is each man that is condemned by
them in the churches very far removed by the intervening
sea from their jurisdiction, not saluted with a kiss as a faithful
Catholic, but driven forth with a blast of indignation as
an impious pagan? And if, in receiving the followers of
Maximianus, they made peace in behalf of their own unity,
far be it from us to find fault with them, save that they cut
their own throats by their decision, that whereas, to preserve
unity in their schism, they collect together again what had
been parted from themselves, they yet scorn to reunite their
schism itself to the true unity of the Church.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xiii.</span>&mdash;14. If, in the interests of the unity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
party of Donatus, no one rebaptizes those who were baptized
in a wicked schism, and men, who are guilty of a crime of
such enormity as to be compared by them in their Council to
those ancient authors of schism whom the earth swallowed
up alive,<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> are either unpunished after separation, or restored
again to their position after condemnation; why is it that, in
defence of the unity of Christ, which is spread throughout
the whole inhabited world, of which it has been predicted
that it shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the
river unto the ends of the earth,<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>&mdash;a prediction which seems
from actual proof to be in process of fulfilment; why is it
that, in defence of this unity, they do not acknowledge the
true and universal law of that inheritance which rings forth
from the books that are common to us all: "I shall give Thee
the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of
the earth for Thy possession?"<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> In behalf of the unity of
Donatus, they are not compelled to call together again what
they have scattered abroad, but are warned to hear the cry of
the Scriptures: why will they not understand that they meet
with such treatment through the mercy of God, that since they
brought false charges against the Catholic Church, by contact
as it were with which they were unwilling to defile their own
excessive sanctity, they should be compelled by the sovereign
authority of Optatus Gildonianus to receive again and associate
with themselves true offences of the greatest enormity,
condemned by the true voice, as they say, of their own
general Council? Let them at length perceive how they are
filled with the true crimes of their own party, after inventing
fictitious crimes wherewith to charge their brethren, when,
even if the charges had been true, they ought at length to
feel how much should be endured in the cause of peace, and
in behalf of Christ's peace to return to a Church which did
not condemn crimes undiscovered, if on behalf of the peace
of Donatus they were ready to pardon such as were condemned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xiv.</span>&mdash;15. Therefore, brethren, let it suffice us that
they should be admonished and corrected on the one point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
their conduct in the matter of the followers of Maximianus.
We do not ransack ancient archives, we do not bring to light
the contents of time-honoured libraries, we do not publish our
proofs to distant lands; but we bring in, as arbiters betwixt us,
all the proofs derived from our ancestors, we spread abroad
the witness that cries aloud throughout the world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XV.</span>&mdash;16. Look at the states of Musti and Assura:
there are many still remaining in this life and in this province
who have severed themselves, and many from whom they
have severed themselves; many who have erected an altar, and
many against whom that altar has been erected; many who
have condemned, and many who have been condemned; who
have received, and who have been received; who have been
baptized outside, and not baptized again within: if all these
things in the cause of unity defile, let the defiled hold their
tongues; if these things in the cause of unity do not defile,
let them submit to correction, and terminate their strife.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XVI.</span>&mdash;17. As for the words which follow in his
letter, the writer himself could scarcely fail to laugh at them,
when, having made an unlearned and lying use of the proof in
which he quotes the words of Scripture, "He who is washed
by the dead, what profiteth him his washing?" he endeavours
to show to us "how far a <i>traditor</i> being still in life may be
accounted dead." And then he goes on further to say: "That
man is dead who has not been worthy to be born again in
true baptism; he is likewise dead, who, although born in
genuine baptism, has joined himself to a <i>traditor</i>." If, therefore,
the followers of Maximianus are not dead, why do the
Donatists say, in their general Council, that "the shores are
covered with their dying bodies?" But if they are dead,
whence is there life in the baptism which they gave? Again,
if Maximianus is not dead, why is a man baptized again who
had been baptized by him? But if he is dead, why is not
also Felicianus of Musti dead with him, who ordained him,
and might have died beyond the sea with some African
colleague or another who was a <i>traditor</i>? Or, if he also is
himself dead, how is there life with him in your society in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
those who, having been baptized outside by him who is dead,
have never been baptized again within?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XVII.</span>&mdash;18. Then he further adds: "Both are without
the life of baptism, both he who never had it at all, and
he who had it but has lost it." He therefore never had it,
whom Felicianus, the follower of Maximianus or Pr√¶textatus,
baptized outside; and these men themselves have lost what
once they had. When, therefore, these were received with
their followers, who gave to those whom they baptized what
previously they did not have? and who restored to themselves
what they had lost? But they took away with them the
form of baptism, but lost the veritable excellence of baptism
by their wicked schism. Why do you repudiate the form itself,
which is holy at all times and all places, in the Catholics
whom you have not heard, whilst you are willing to acknowledge
it in the followers of Maximianus whom you have
punished?</p>

<p>19. But whatever he seemed to himself to say by way of
accusation about the traitor Judas, I see not how it can concern
us, who are not proved by them to have betrayed our
trust; nor, indeed, if such treason were proved on the part of
any who before our time have died in our communion, would
that treason in any way defile us by whom it was disavowed,
and to whom it was displeasing. For if they themselves are
not defiled by offences condemned by themselves, and afterwards
condoned, how much less can we be defiled by what
we have disavowed so soon as we have heard of them!
However weighty, therefore, his invective against <i>traditors</i>, let
him be assured that they are condemned by me in precisely
the same terms. But yet I make a distinction; for he accuses
one on my side who has long been dead without having
been condemned in any investigation made by me. I point
to a man adhering closely to his side, who had been condemned
by him, or at least had been separated by a sacrilegious
schism, and whom he received again with undiminished
honour.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XVIII.</span>&mdash;20. He says: "You who are a most aban<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>doned
<i>traditor</i> have come out in the character of a persecutor
and murderer of us who keep the law." If the followers of
Maximianus kept the law when they separated from you,
then we may acknowledge you as a keeper of the law, when
you are separated from the Church spread abroad throughout
the world. But if you raise the question of persecutions, I
at once reply: If you have suffered anything unjustly, this
does not concern those who, though they disapprove of men
who act in such a way,<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> yet endure them for the peace that
is in unity, in a manner deserving of all praise. Wherefore
you have nothing to bring up against the Lord's wheat, who
endure the chaff that is among them till the last winnowing,
from whom you never would have separated yourself, had you
not shown yourself lighter than chaff by flying away under
the blast of temptation before the coming of the Winnower.
But not to leave this one example, which the Lord hath
thrust back in their teeth, to close the mouths of these men,
for their correction if they will show themselves to be wise,
but for their confusion if they remain in their folly: if those
are more just that suffer persecution than those who inflict it,
then those same followers of Maximianus are the more just,
whose basilica was utterly overthrown, and who were grievously
maltreated by the military following of Optatus, when the
mandates of the proconsul, ordering that all of them should
be shut out of the basilicas, were manifestly procured by the
followers of Primianus. Wherefore, if, when the emperors
hated their communion, they ventured on such violent measures
for the persecution of the followers of Maximianus,
what would they do if they were enabled to work their will
by being in communion with kings? And if they did such
things as I have mentioned for the correction of the wicked,
why are they surprised that Catholic emperors should decree
with greater power that they should be worked upon and
corrected who endeavour to rebaptize the whole Christian
world, when they have no ground for differing from them?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
seeing that they themselves bear witness that it is right to
bear with wicked men even where they have true charges to
bring against them in the cause of peace, since they received
those whom they had themselves condemned, acknowledging
the honours conferred among themselves, and the baptism
administered in schism. Let them at length consider what
treatment they deserve at the hands of the Christian powers
of the world, who are the enemies of Christian unity throughout
the world. If, therefore, correction be bitter, yet let them
not fail to be ashamed; lest, when they begin to read what
they themselves have written, they be overcome with laughter,
when they do not find in themselves what they wish to find
in others, and fail to recognise<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> in their own case what they
find fault with in their neighbours.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XIX.</span>&mdash;21. What, then, does he mean by quoting in
his letter the words with which our Lord addressed the Jews:
"Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men,
and scribes; and some of them ye shall kill and crucify, and
some of them shall ye scourge"?<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> For if by the wise men
and the scribes and the prophets they would have themselves
be understood, while we were as it were the persecutors of
the prophets and wise men, why are they unwilling to speak
with us, seeing they are sent to us? For, indeed, if the man
who wrote that epistle which we are at this present moment
answering, were to be pressed by us to acknowledge it as his
own, stamping its authenticity with his signature, I question
much whether he would do it, so thoroughly afraid are they
of our possessing any words of theirs. For when we were
anxious by some means or other to procure the latter part of
this same letter, because those from whom we obtained it were
unable to describe the whole of it, no one who was asked for
it was willing to give it to us, so soon as they knew that we
were making a reply to the portion which we had. Therefore,
when they read how the Lord says to the prophet, "Cry aloud,
spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
their transgression,"<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> these men who are sent to us as prophets
have no fears on this score, but take every precaution that
their crying may not be heard by us: which they certainly
would not fear if what they spoke of us were true. But their
apprehension is not groundless, as it is written in the Psalm,
"The mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped."<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> For
if the reason that they do not receive our baptism be that
we are a generation of vipers&mdash;to use the expression in his
epistle&mdash;why did they receive the baptism of the followers of
Maximianus, of whom their Council speaks in the following
terms: "Because the enfolding of a poisoned womb has long
concealed the baneful offspring of a viper's seed, and the moist
concretions of conceived iniquity have by slow heat flowed
forth into the members of serpents?" Is it not therefore of
themselves also that it is said in the same Council, "The
poison of asps is under their lips, their mouth is full of
cursing and bitterness, their feet are swift to shed blood;
destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of
peace have they not known"?<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> And yet they now hold these
men themselves in undiminished honour, and receive within
their body those whom these men had baptized without.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XX.</span>&mdash;22. Wherefore all this about the generation of
vipers, and the poison of asps under their lips, and all the
other things which they have said against those which have
not known the way of peace, are really, if they would but
speak the truth, more strictly applicable to themselves, since
for the sake of the peace of Donatus they received the baptism
of these men, in respect of which they used the expressions
quoted above in the wording of the decree of the Council;
but the baptism of the Church of Christ dispersed throughout
the world, from which peace itself came into Africa, they
repudiate, to the sacrilegious wounding of the peace of Christ.
Which, therefore, are rather the false prophets, who come in
sheep's clothing, whilst inwardly they are ravening wolves,<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>&mdash;they
who either fail to detect the wicked in the Catholic
Church, and communicate with them in all innocence, or else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
for the sake of the peace of unity are bearing with those whom
they cannot separate from the threshing-floor of the Lord
before the Winnower shall come; or they who do in schism
what they censure in the Catholic Church, and receive in their
own separation, when manifest to all and condemned by their
own voice, what they profess that they shun in the unity of
the Church when it calls for toleration, and does not even
certainly exist?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XXI.</span>&mdash;23. Lastly, it has been said, as he himself has
also quoted, "Ye shall know them by their fruits:"<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> let us
therefore examine into their fruits. You bring up against our
predecessors their delivery of the sacred books. This very
charge we urge with greater probability against their accusers
themselves. And not to carry our search too far, in the same
city of Constantina your predecessors ordained Silvanus bishop
at the very outset of his schism. He, while he was still a sub-deacon,
was most unmistakeably entered as a <i>traditor</i> in the
archives of the city. If you on your side bring forward documents
against our predecessors, all that we ask is equal terms,&mdash;that
we should either believe both to be true or both to be
false. If both are true, you are unquestionably guilty of
schism, who have pretended that you avoid offences in the
communion of the whole world, which you had commonly
among you in the small fragment of your own sect. But
again, if both are false, you are unquestionably guilty of
schism, who, on account of the false charges of giving up the
sacred books, are staining yourselves with the heinous offence
of severance from the Church. But if we have something to
urge in accusation while you have nothing, or if our charges
are true whilst yours are false, it is no longer matter of discussion
how thoroughly your mouths are closed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XXII.</span>&mdash;24. What if the holy and true Church of
Christ were to convince and overcome you, even if we held
no documents in support of our cause, or only such as were
false, while you had possession of some genuine proofs of delivery
of the sacred books? what would then remain for you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
except that, if you would, you should show your love of peace,
or otherwise should hold your tongues?<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> For whatever, in
that case, you might bring forward in evidence, I should be able
to say with the greatest ease and the most perfect truth, that
then you are bound to prove as much to the full and catholic
unity of the Church already spread abroad and established
throughout so many nations, to the end that you should
remain within, and that those whom you convict should be
expelled. And if you have endeavoured to do this, certainly
you have not been able to make good your proof; and being
vanquished or enraged, you have separated yourselves, with
all the heinous guilt of sacrilege, from the guiltless men who
could not condemn on insufficient proof. But if you have
not even endeavoured to do this, then with most accursed
and unnatural blindness you have cut yourselves off from the
wheat of Christ, which grows throughout His whole fields,
that is, throughout the whole world, until the end, because
you have taken offence at a few tares in Africa.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XXIII.</span>&mdash;25. In conclusion, the Testament is said to
have been given to the flames by certain men in the time of
persecution. Now let its lessons be read, from whatever
source it has been brought to light. Certainly in the beginning
of the promises of the Testator this is found to have
been said to Abraham: "In thy seed shall all the nations of
the earth be blessed;"<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> and this saying is truthfully interpreted
by the apostle: "To thy seed," he says, "which is
Christ."<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> No betrayal on the part of any man has made the
promises of God of none effect. Hold communion with all
the nations of the earth, and then you may boast that you
have preserved the Testament from the destruction of the
flames. But if you will not do so, which party is the rather
to be believed to have insisted on the burning of the Testament,
save that which will not assent to its teaching when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
is brought to light? For how much more certainly, without
any sacrilegious rashness, can he be held to have joined the
company of <i>traditors</i> who now persecutes with his tongue the
Testament which they are said to have persecuted with the
flames! You charge us with the persecution: the true wheat
of the Lord answers you, "Either it was done justly, or it was
done by the chaff that was among us." What have you to
say to this? You object that we have no baptism: the same
true wheat of the Lord answers you, that the form of the
sacrament even within the Church fails to profit some, as it
did no good to Simon Magus when he was baptized, much
more it fails to profit those who are without. Yet that baptism
remains in them when they depart, is proved from this, that it
is not restored to them when they return. Never, therefore,
except by the greatest shamelessness, will you be able to cry
out against that wheat, or to call them false prophets clad in
sheep's clothing, whilst inwardly they are ravening wolves;
since either they do not know the wicked in the unity of the
Catholic Church, or for the sake of unity bear with those
whom they know.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XXIV.</span>&mdash;26. But let us turn to the consideration of
your fruits. I pass over the tyrannous exercise of authority
in the cities, and especially in the estates of other men; I
pass over the madness of the Circumcelliones, and the sacrilegious
and profane adoration of the bodies of those who had
thrown themselves of their own accord over precipices, the
revellings of drunkenness, and the ten years' groaning of the
whole of Africa under the cruelty of the one man Optatus
Gildonianus: all this I pass over, because there are certain
among you who cry out that these things are, and have ever
been, displeasing to them. But they say that they bore with
them in the cause of peace, because they could not put them
down; wherein they condemn themselves by their own judgment:
for if indeed they felt such love for peace, they never
would have rent in twain the bond of unity. For what madness
can be greater, than to be willing to abandon peace in
the midst of peace itself, and to be anxious to retain it in the
midst of discord? Therefore, for the sake of those who pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>tend
that they do not see the evils of this same faction of
Donatus, which all men see and blame, ignoring them even
to the extent of saying of Optatus himself, "What did he
do?" "Who accused him?" "Who convicted him?" "I know
nothing," "I saw nothing," "I heard nothing,"&mdash;for the sake
of these, I say, who pretend that they are ignorant of what
is generally notorious, the party of Maximianus has arisen,
through whom their eyes are opened, and their mouths are
closed: for they openly sever themselves; they openly erect
altar against altar; they are openly in a Council<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> called sacrilegious
and vipers, and swift to shed blood, to be compared
with Dathan and Abiram and Korah, and are condemned in
cutting terms of abhorrence; and are as openly received again
with undiminished honours in company with those whom they
have baptized. Such are the fruits of these men, who do all
this for the peace of Donatus, that they may clothe themselves
in sheep's clothing, and reject the peace of Christ
throughout the world that they may be ravening wolves
within the fold.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XXV.</span>&mdash;27. I think that I have left unanswered none
of the statements in the letter of Donatus, so far at least as
relates to what I have been able to find in that part of which
we are in possession. I should be glad if they would produce
the other part as well, in case there should be anything in it
which does not admit of refutation. But as for these answers
which we have made to him, with the help of God, I admonish
your Christian love, that ye not only communicate
them to those who seek for them, but also force them on those
who show no longing for them. Let them answer anything
they will; and if they shrink from sending a reply to us, let
them at any rate send letters to their own party, only not
forbidding that the contents should be shown to us. For if
they do this, they show their fruits most openly, by which
they are proved to demonstration to be ravening wolves disguised
in sheep's clothing, in that they secretly lay snares for
our sheep, and openly shrink from giving any answer to the
shepherds. We only lay to their charge the sin of schism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
in which they are all most thoroughly involved,&mdash;not the
offences of certain of their party, which some of them declare
to be displeasing to themselves. If they, on the other hand,
abstain from charging us with the sins of other men, they
have nothing they can lay to our charge, and therefore they
are wholly unable to defend themselves from the charge of
schism; because it is by a wicked severance that they have
separated themselves from the threshing-floor of the Lord,
and from the innocent company of the corn that is growing
throughout the world, on account of charges which either
are false, and invented by themselves, or even if true, involve
the chaff alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XXVI.</span>&mdash;28. But it is possible that you may expect
of me that I should go on to refute what he has introduced
about Manich√¶us. Now, in respect of this, the only thing
that offends me is that he has censured a most pestilent and
pernicious error&mdash;I mean the heresy of the Manich√¶ans&mdash;in
terms of wholly inadequate severity, if indeed they amount
to censure at all, though the Catholic Church has broken
down his defences by the strongest evidence of truth.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> For
the inheritance of Christ, established in all nations, is secure
against heresies which have been shut out from the inheritance;
but, as the Lord says, "How can Satan cast out
Satan?"<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> so how can the error of the Donatists have power
to overthrow the error of the Manich√¶ans?<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XXVII.</span>&mdash;29. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, though
that error is exposed and overcome in many ways, and dare
not oppose the truth on any show of reason whatsoever, but
only with the unblushing obstinacy of impudence; yet, not
to load your memory with a multitude of proofs, I would
have you bear in mind this one action of the followers of
Maximianus, confront them with this one fact, thrust this in
their teeth, to make them hold their treacherous tongues,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
destroy their calumny with this, as it were a three-pronged
dart destroying a three-headed monster. They charge us
with betrayal of the sacred books; they charge us with persecution;
they charge us with false baptism: to all their
charges make the same answer about the followers of Maximianus.
For they think that the proofs are lost which show
that their predecessors gave the sacred volumes to the flames;
but this at least they cannot hide, that they have received
with unimpaired honours those who were stained with the
sacrilege of schism. Also they think that those most violent
persecutions are hidden, which they direct against any who
oppose them whenever they are able; but whilst spiritual
persecution surpasses bodily persecution, they received with
undiminished honours the followers of Maximianus, whom
they themselves persecuted in the body, and of whom they
themselves said, "Their feet are swift to shed blood;"<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> and
this at any rate they cannot hide.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XXVIII.</span> Finally, they think that the question of
baptism is hidden, with which they deceive wretched souls.
But whilst they say that none have baptism who were baptized
outside the communion of the one Church, they received with
undiminished honours the followers of Maximianus, with those
whom they baptized in schism outside the Donatist communion,
and this at least they cannot hide.</p>

<p>30. "But these things," they say, "bring no pollution in
the cause of peace; and it is well to bend to mercy the rigour
of extreme severity, that broken branches may be grafted in
anew." Accordingly, in this way the whole question is settled,
by defeat in them, by the impossibility of defeat for us; for
if the name of peace be assumed for even the faintest shadow
of defence to justify the bearing with wicked men in schism,
then beyond all doubt the violation of true peace itself involves
detestable guilt, with nothing to be said in its defence
throughout the unity of the world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XXIX.</span>&mdash;31. These things, brethren, I would have
you retain as the basis of your action and preaching with un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>tiring
gentleness: love men, while you destroy errors; take
of the truth without pride; strive for the truth without cruelty.
Pray for those whom you refute and convince of error. For
the prophet prays to God for mercy upon such as these, saying,
"Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek Thy
name, O Lord."<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> And this, indeed, the Lord has done already,
so as to fill the faces of the followers of Maximianus
with shame in the sight of all mankind: it only remains that
they should learn how to blush to their soul's health. For
so they will be able to seek the name of the Lord, from which
they are turned away to their utter destruction, whilst they
exalt their own name in the place of that of Christ. May
ye live and persevere in Christ, and be multiplied, and abound
in the love of God, and in love towards one another, and
towards all men, brethren well beloved.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><small>IN WHICH AUGUSTINE REPLIES TO ALL THE SEVERAL STATEMENTS IN THE
LETTER OF PETILIANUS, AS THOUGH DISPUTING WITH AN ADVERSARY
FACE TO FACE.</small></p></blockquote>


<p class="cap">CHAP. I.&mdash;1. That we made a full and sufficient answer
to the first part of the letter of Petilianus, which was
all that we had been able to find, will be remembered by all
who were able to read or hear what we replied. But since
the whole of it was afterwards found and copied by our
brethren, and sent to us with the view that we should answer
it as a whole, this task was one which our pen could not
escape,&mdash;not that he says anything new in it, to which answer
has not been already made in many ways and at various
times; but still, on account of the brethren of slower comprehension,
who, when they read a matter in any place, cannot
always refer to everything that has been said upon the
same subject, I will comply with those who urge me by all
means to reply to every point, and that as though we were
carrying on the discussion face to face in the form of a
dialogue. I will set down the words of his epistle under his
name, and I will give the answer under my own name,
as though it had all been taken down by reporters while
we were debating. And so there will be no one who can
complain either that I have passed anything over, or that
they have been unable to understand it for want of distinction
between the parties to the discussion; at the same
time that the Donatists themselves, who are unwilling to
argue the question in our presence, as is shown by the
letters which they have circulated among their party, may
thus not fail to find the truth answering them point by point,
just as though they were discussing the matter with us face
to face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>2. In the very beginning of the letter <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said:
"Petilianus, a bishop, to his well-beloved brethren, fellow-priests,
and deacons, appointed ministers with us throughout
our diocese in the gospel, grace be to you and peace, from
God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: I acknowledge the apostolic
greeting. You see who you are that employ it, but see from
what source you have learned what you say. For in these
terms Paul salutes the Romans, and in the same terms the
Corinthians, the Galatians, the Ephesians, the Colossians, the
Philippians, the Thessalonians. What madness is it, therefore,
to be unwilling to share the salvation of peace with
those very Churches in whose epistles you learned its form of
salutation?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>&mdash;4. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "Those who have polluted
their souls with a guilty laver, under the name of baptism,
reproach us with baptizing twice,&mdash;than whose obscenity,
indeed, any kind of filth is more cleanly, seeing that through
a perversion of cleanliness they have come to be made fouler
by their washing."</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: We are neither made fouler by
our washing, nor cleaner by yours. But when the water
of baptism is given to any one in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, it is neither ours
nor yours, but His of whom it was said to John, "Upon
whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining
on Him, the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy
Ghost."<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>&mdash;6. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "For what we look
to is the conscience of the giver, to cleanse that of the
recipient."</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: We therefore need have no
anxiety about the conscience of Christ. But if you assert any
man to be the giver, be he who he may, there will be no certainty
about the cleansing of the recipient, because there is no
certainty about the conscience of the giver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>&mdash;8. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "For he who receives
faith from the faithless, receives not faith but guilt."</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: Christ is not faithless, from
whom the faithful man receives not guilt but faith. For he
believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, that his faith
may be counted for righteousness.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>&mdash;10. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "For everything consists
of an origin and root; and if it have not something for a head,
it is nothing: nor does anything well receive second birth,
unless it be born again of good seed."</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: Why will you put yourself forward
in the room of Christ, when you will not place yourself
under Him? He is the origin, and root, and head of him
who is being born, and in Him we feel no fear, as we must
in any man, whoever he may be, lest he should prove to be
false and of abandoned character, and we should be found to
be sprung from an abandoned source, growing from an abandoned
root, united to an abandoned head. For what man can
feel secure about a man, when it is written, "Cursed be the
man that trusteth in man?"<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> But the seed of which we are
born again is the word of God, that is, the gospel. Whence
the apostle says, "For in Christ Jesus I have begotten you
through the gospel."<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> And yet he allows even those to
preach the gospel who were preaching it not in purity, and
rejoices in their preaching;<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> because, although they were
preaching it not in purity, but seeking their own, not the
things which are Jesus Christ's,<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> yet the gospel which they
preached was pure. And the Lord had said of certain of like
character, "Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe
and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and
do not."<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> If, therefore, what is in itself pure is preached in
purity, then the preacher himself also, in that he is a partner
with the word, has his share in begetting the believer; but if
he himself be not regenerate, and yet what he preaches be
pure, then the believer is born not from the barrenness of the
minister, but from the fruitfulness of the word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. vi.</span>&mdash;12. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "This being the case,
brethren, what perversity must it be, that he who is guilty
through his own sins should make another free from guilt,
when the Lord Jesus Christ says, 'Every good tree bringeth
forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit:
do men gather grapes of thorns?<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> And again: 'A good
man, out of the good treasure of the heart, bringeth forth good
things: and an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth
forth evil things.'"<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: No man, even though he be
not guilty through his own sins, can make his neighbour free
from sin, because he is not God. Otherwise, if we were to
expect that out of the innocence of the baptizer should be
produced the innocence of the baptized, then each will be the
more innocent in proportion as he may have found a more
innocent person by whom to be baptized; and will himself
be the less innocent in proportion as he by whom he is baptized
is less innocent. And if the man who baptizes happens
to entertain hatred against another man, this will also be
imputed to him who is baptized. Why, therefore, does the
wretched man hasten to be baptized,&mdash;that his own sins
may be forgiven him, or that those of others may be reckoned
against him? Is he like a merchant ship, to discharge one
burden, and to take on him another? But by the good tree
and its good fruit, and the corrupt tree and its evil fruit, we
are wont to understand men and their works, as is consequently
shown in those other words which you also quoted:
"A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth
forth good things: and an evil man, out of the evil treasure,
bringeth forth evil things." But when a man preaches the
word of God, or administers the sacraments of God, he does
not, if he is a bad man, preach or minister out of his own
treasure; but he will be counted among those of whom it is
said, "Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do;
but do not ye after their works:" for they bid you observe
what is God's, but their works are their own. For if it is as
you say, that is, if the fruit of those who baptize consist in
the baptized persons themselves; you declare a great woe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
against Africa, if a young Optatus has sprung up for every
one that Optatus baptized.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. vii.</span>&mdash;14. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "And again, 'He who is
baptized by one that is dead, his washing profiteth him
nothing.'<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> He did not mean that the baptizer was a corpse,
a lifeless body, the remains of a man ready for burial, but
one lacking the Spirit of God, who is compared to a dead
body, as He declares to a disciple in another place, according
to the witness of the gospel. For His disciple says, 'Lord,
suffer me first to go and bury my father. But Jesus said unto
him, Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.'<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> The
father of the disciple was not baptized. He declared him as a
pagan to belong to the company of pagans; unless he said
this of the unbelieving, The dead cannot bury the dead. He
was dead, therefore, not as smitten by some death, but as
smitten even during life. For he who so lives as to be doomed
to eternal death is tortured by a death in life. To be baptized,
therefore, by the dead, is to have received not life but
death. We must therefore consider and declare how far the
<i>traditor</i> is to be accounted dead while yet alive. He is
dead who has not deserved to be born again with a true baptism;
he is likewise dead who, having been born again with
a true baptism, has become involved with a <i>traditor</i>. Both are
wanting in the life of baptism,&mdash;both he who never had it at
all, and he who had it and has lost it. For the Lord Jesus
Christ says, 'There shall come to that man seven spirits more
wicked than the former one, and the last state of that man
shall be worse than the first.'"<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

<p>15. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: Seek with greater care to know
in what sense the words which you have quoted from Scripture
in proof of your position were really uttered, and how
they should be understood. For that all unrighteous persons
are wont to be called dead in a mystical sense is clear enough;
but Christ, to whom true baptism belongs, which you say is
false because of the faults of men, is alive, sitting at the
right hand of the Father, and He will not die any more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
through any infirmity of the flesh: death will no more have
dominion over Him.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> And they who are baptized with His
baptism are not baptized by one who is dead. And if it so
happen that certain ministers, being deceitful workers, seeking
their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's, proclaiming
the gospel not in purity, and preaching Christ of contention
and envy, are to be called dead because of their unrighteousness,
yet the sacrament of the living God does not die
even in one that is dead. For that Simon was dead who was
baptized by Philip in Samaria, who wished to purchase the
gift of God for money;<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> but the baptism which he had lived
in him still to work his punishment.</p>

<p>16. But how false the statement is which you make, that
"both are wanting in the life of baptism, both he who never
had it at all, and he who had it and has lost it," you may see
from this, that in the case of those who apostatize after having
been baptized, and who return through penitence, baptism is
not restored to them, as it would be restored if it were lost.
In what manner, indeed, do your dead men baptize according
to your interpretation? Must we not reckon the drunken
among the dead (to say nothing of the rest, and to mention
only what is well known and of daily experience among all),
seeing that the apostle says of the widow, "But she that liveth
in pleasure is dead while she liveth?"<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> In the next place, in
that Council of yours, in which you condemned Maximianus
with his advisers or his ministers, have you forgotten with
what eloquence you said, "Even after the manner of the
Egyptians, the shores are full of the bodies of the dying, on
whom the weightier punishment falls in death itself, in that,
after their life has been wrung from them by the avenging
waters, they have not found so much as burial?" And yet
you yourselves may see whether or no one of them, Felicianus,
has been brought to life again; yet he has with him within
the communion of your body those whom he baptized outside.
As therefore he is baptized by One that is alive who
is clothed with the baptism of the living Christ, so he is baptized
by the dead who is wrapped in the baptism of the dead
Saturn, or any one like him; that we may set forth in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
meanwhile, with what brevity we may, in what sense the
words which you have quoted may be understood without any
cavilling on the part of any one of us. For, in the sense in
which they are received by you, you make no effort to explain
them, but only strive to entangle us together with yourselves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. viii.</span>&mdash;17. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "We must consider, I
say, and declare how far the treacherous <i>traditor</i> is to be
accounted dead while yet in life. Judas was an apostle when
he betrayed Christ; and the same man was already dead,
having spiritually lost the office of an apostle, being destined
afterwards to die by hanging himself, as it is written: 'I
have sinned,' says he, 'in that I have betrayed the innocent
blood; and he departed, and went and hanged himself'<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> The
traitor perished by the rope: he left the rope for others like
himself, of whom the Lord Christ cried aloud to the Father,
'Father, those that Thou gavest me I have kept, and none of
them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the Scripture might
be fulfilled.'<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> For David of old had passed this sentence on
him who was to betray Christ to the unbelievers: 'Let another
take his office. Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a
widow.'<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> See how mighty is the spirit of the prophets, that
it was able to see all future things as though they were present,
so that a traitor who was to be born hereafter should be
condemned many centuries before. Finally, that the said sentence
should be completed, the holy Matthias received the
bishopric of that lost apostle. Let no one be so dull, no one
so faithless, as to dispute this: Matthias won for himself a
victory, not a wrong, in that he carried off the spoils of the
traitor from the victory of the Lord Christ. Why then, after
this, do you claim to yourself a bishopric as the heir of a
worse traitor? Judas betrayed Christ in the flesh to the
unbelievers; you in the spirit madly betrayed the holy gospel
to the flames of sacrilege. Judas betrayed the Lawgiver to
the unbelievers; you, as it were, betraying all that he had left,
gave up the law of God to be destroyed by men. Whilst, had
you loved the law, like the youthful Maccabees, you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
have welcomed death for the sake of the laws of God (if
indeed that can be said to be death to men which makes them
immortal because they died for the Lord); for of those brethren
we learn that one replied to the sacrilegious tyrant with these
words of faith: 'Thou like a fury takest us out of this present
life; but the King of the world (who reigns for ever, and
of His kingdom there shall be no end) shall raise us up who
have died for His laws, unto everlasting life.'<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> If you were
to burn with fire the testament of a dead man, would you
not be punished as the falsifier of a will? What therefore
is likely to become of you who have burned the most holy
law of our God and Judge? Judas repented of his deed even
in death; you not only do not repent, but stand forth as a
persecutor and butcher of us who keep the law, whilst you
are the most wicked of <i>traditors</i>."</p>

<p>18. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: See what a difference there is
between your calumnious words and our truthful assertions.
Listen for a little while. See how you have exaggerated the sin
of delivering up the sacred books, comparing us in most odious
terms, like some sophistical inventor of charges, with the traitor
Judas. But when I shall have answered you on this point
with the utmost brevity,&mdash;I did not do what you assert; I did
not deliver up the sacred books; your charge is false; you will
never be able to prove it,&mdash;will not all that smoke of mighty
words presently vanish away? Or will you perchance endeavour
to prove the truth of what you say? This, then, you
should do first; and then you might rise against us, as against
men who were already convicted, with whatever mass of invective
you might choose. Here is one absurdity: behold
again a second.</p>

<p>19. You yourself, when speaking of the foretelling of the
condemnation of Judas, used these expressions: "See how
mighty is the spirit of the prophets, that it was able to see
all future things as though they were present, so that a traitor
who was to be born hereafter should be condemned many centuries
before;" and yet you did not see that in the same sure
prophecy, and certain and unshaken truth, in which it was
foretold that one of the disciples should hereafter betray the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
Christ, it was also foretold that the whole world should hereafter
believe in Christ. Why did you pay attention in the
prophecy to the man who betrayed Christ, and in the same
place give no heed to the world for which Christ was betrayed?
Who betrayed Christ? Judas. To whom did he
betray Him? To the Jews. What did the Jews do to Him?
"They pierced my hands and my feet," says the Psalmist.
"I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me. They
part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture."<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>
Of what importance, then, that is which is bought
at such a price, I would have you read a little later in the
psalm itself: "All the ends of the world shall remember and
turn unto the Lord; and all the kindreds of the nations shall
worship before Thee. For the kingdom is the Lord's; and He
is the governor among the nations."<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> But who is able to
suffice for the quotation of all the other innumerable prophetic
passages which bear witness to the world that is destined
to believe? Yet you quote a prophecy because you
see in it the man who sold Christ: you do not see in it the
possession which Christ bought by being sold. Here is the
second absurdity: behold again the third.</p>

<p>20. Among the many other expressions in your invective,
you said: "If you were to burn with fire the testament of a
dead man, would you not be punished as the falsifier of a
will? What therefore is likely to become of you who have
burned the most holy law of our God and Judge?" In these
words you have paid no attention to what certainly ought to
have moved you, to the question of how it might be that we
should burn the testament, and yet stand fast in the inheritance
which was described in that testament; but it is marvellous
that you have preserved the testament and lost the
inheritance. Is it not written in that testament, "Ask of
me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,
and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession?"<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>
Take part in this inheritance, and you may bring what charges
you will against me about the testament. For what madness
is it, that while you shrank from committing the testament to
the flames, you should yet strive against the words of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
testator! We, on the other hand, though we hold in our
hands the records of the Church and of the State, in which we
read that those who ordained a rival bishop<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> in opposition to
C√¶cilianus were rather the betrayers of the sacred books, yet
do not on this account insult you, or pursue you with invectives,
or mourn over the ashes of the sacred pages in your
hands, or contrast the burning torments of the Maccabees
with the sacrilege of your fear, saying, "You should deliver
your own limbs to the flames rather than the utterances of God."
For we are unwilling to be so absurd as to excite an empty uproar
against you on account of the deeds of others, which you
either know nothing of, or else repudiate. But in that we
see you separated from the communion of the whole world
(a sin both of the greatest magnitude, and manifest to all
mankind, and common to you all), if I were desirous of exaggerating,
I should find time failing me sooner than words.
And if you should seek to defend yourself on this charge, it
could only be by bringing accusations against the whole world,
of such a kind that, if they could be maintained, you would
simply be furnishing matter for further accusation against
yourself; if they could not be maintained, there is in them no
defence for you. Why therefore do you puff yourself up
against me about the betrayal of the sacred books, which concerns
neither you nor me if we abide by the agreement not to
charge each other with the sins of other men, and which, if
that agreement does not stand, affects you rather than me?
And yet, even without any violation of that agreement, I
think I may say with perfect justice that he should be
deemed a partner with him who delivered up Christ who has
not delivered himself up to Christ in company with the whole
world. "Then," says the apostle, "then are ye Abraham's
seed, and heirs according to the promise."<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> And again he
says, "Heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ."<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> And the
same apostle shows that the seed of Abraham belongs to all
nations, from the promise which was given to Abraham, "In
thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>
Wherefore I consider that I am only making a fair demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
in asking that we should for a moment consider the testament
of God, which has already long been opened, and that we
should consider every one to be himself an heir of the traitor
whom we do not find to be a joint-heir with Him whom he
betrayed; that every one should belong to him who sold
Christ who denies that Christ has bought the whole world.
For when He showed Himself after His resurrection to His
disciples, and gave His limbs to those who doubted, that they
should handle them, He says this to them, "For thus it is
written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise
again from the dead the third day: and that repentance and
remission of sins should be preached in His name among all
nations, beginning at Jerusalem."<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> See from what an inheritance
you estrange yourselves! see what an Heir you
resist! Can it really be that a man would spare Christ if
He were walking here on earth who speaks against Him while
He sits in heaven? Do you not yet understand that whatever
you allege against us you allege against His words?
A Christian world is promised and believed in: the promise
is fulfilled, and it is denied. Consider, I entreat of you, what
you ought to suffer for such impiety. And yet, if I know
not what you have suffered,&mdash;if I have not seen it, have not
wrought it,&mdash;then do you to-day, who do not suffer the violence
of my persecution, render to me an account of your
separation. But you are likely to say over and over again
what, unless you prove it, can affect no one, and if you prove
it, has no bearing upon me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>&mdash;21. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "Hemmed in, therefore,
by these offences, you cannot be a true bishop."</p>

<p>22. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: By what offences? What have
you shown? What have you proved? And if you have
proved charges on the part of I know not whom, what has
that to do with the seed of Abraham, in which all the nations
of the earth are blessed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. X.</span>&mdash;23. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "Did the apostles persecute
any one? or did Christ betray any one?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>24. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: I might indeed say that Satan
himself was worse than all wicked men; and yet the apostle
delivered a man over to him for the destruction of the flesh,
that his spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a>
And in the same way he delivered over others, of whom he
says, "Whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may
learn not to blaspheme."<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> And the Lord Christ drove out the
impious merchants from the temple with scourges; in which
connection we also find advanced the testimony of Scripture,
where it says, "The zeal of Thine house hath eaten me up."<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>
So that we do find the apostle delivering over to condemnation,
and Christ a persecutor. All this I might say, and put
you into no small heat and perturbation, so that you would
be compelled to inquire, not into the complaints of those who
suffer, but into the intention of those who cause the suffering.
But do not trouble yourself about this; I do not say this. But
I do say that it has nothing to do with the seed of Abraham,
which is in all nations, if anything has been done to you
which ought not to have been done, perhaps by the chaff among
the harvest of the Lord, which in spite of this is found among
all nations. Do you therefore render an account of your separation.
But first, consider what kind of men you have among
you, with whom you would not wish to be reproached; and see
how unjustly you act, when you cast in our teeth the acts of
other men, even if you proved what you assert. Therefore it
will be found that there is no ground for your separation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XI.</span>&mdash;25. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "Yet some will be found
to say, We are not the sons of a <i>traditor</i>. Any one is the
son of that man whose deeds he imitates. For those are most
assuredly sons, and at the same time bear a strong resemblance
to their parents, who are born in the likeness of their
parents, not only as being of their flesh and blood, but in respect
of their characters and deeds."</p>

<p>26. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: A little while ago you were
saying nothing contrary to us, now you even begin to say
something in our favour. For this proposition of yours binds
you to as much as this, that if you shall fail to-day to convict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
us, with whom you are arguing, of being <i>traditors</i> and murderers,
and anything else with which you charge us, you
will then be wholly powerless to hurt us by any charge of
the kind which you may prove against those who have gone
before us. For we cannot be the sons of those to whose
deeds our actions bear no resemblance. And see to what you
have committed yourself. If you should be so successful as
to convict some man, even of our own times, and living with
us, of any guilt of the kind, that is in no way to the prejudice
of all the nations of the earth who are blessed in the
seed of Abraham, by separating yourself from whom you are
found to be guilty of sacrilege. Accordingly, unless (as is
altogether impossible) you are acquainted with all men that
exist throughout the world, and have not only made yourself
familiar with all their characters and deeds, but have also
proved that they are as bad as you describe, you have no
ground for reproaching all the world, which is among the
saints, with parentage of I know not what description, to
whom you prove that they are like. Nor will it help you at
all, even if you are able to show that those who are not of
the same character take the holy sacraments in common with
those who are. In the first place, because you ought yourselves
to look at those with whom you celebrate those sacraments,
to whom you give them, from whom you receive them,
and whom you would be unwilling to have cast up against
you as a reproach. And again, if all those are the sons of
Judas, who was the devil among the apostles, who imitate
his deeds, why do we not call those the sons of the apostles
who make such men partakers, not in their own deeds, but in
the sacraments of the Lord, as the apostles partook of the
supper of the Lord in company with that traitor? and in
this way they are very different from you, who cast in the
teeth of men who are striving for the preservation of unity
the very thing that you do to the rending asunder of unity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span>&mdash;27. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "The Lord Jesus said
to the Jews concerning Himself, 'If I do not the works of my
Father, believe me not.'"<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></p>

This is both true, and makes for us against you.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xiii.</span>&mdash;29. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "Over and over again
He reproaches the false speakers and liars in such terms as
these: 'Ye are the children of the devil, for he also was a
slanderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth.'"</p>

<p>30. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: We are not wont to say, "He
was a slanderer," but "He was a murderer."<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> But we ask
how it was that the devil was a murderer from the beginning;
and we find that he slew the first man, not by drawing a
sword, nor by applying to him any bodily violence, but by
persuading him to sin, and thus driving him from the happiness
of Paradise. What then was Paradise is now represented
by the Church. Therefore those are the sons of the devil
who slay men by withdrawing them from the Church. But
as by the words of God we know what was the situation of
Paradise, so now by the words of Christ we have learned
where the Church is to be found: "Throughout all nations,"
He says, "beginning at Jerusalem." Whosoever, therefore,
separates a man from that complete whole to place him in
any single part, is proved to be a son of the devil and a
murderer. But see, further, what is the application of the
expression which you yourself employed in saying of the
devil, "He was a slanderer, and abode not in the truth."
For you bring an accusation against the whole world on
account of the sins of others, though even those others themselves
you were more able to accuse than to convict; and
you abode not in the truth of Christ. For He says that the
Church is "throughout all nations, beginning at Jerusalem;"
but ye say that it is in the party of Donatus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xiv.</span>&mdash;31. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "In the third place,
also, He calls the madness of persecutors in like manner by
this name, 'Ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the
damnation of hell? Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets,
and wise men, and scribes; and some of them ye shall
kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
synagogues, and persecute them from city to city: that upon
you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth,
from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias,
son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the
altar.'<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> Are they then really the sons of vipers according to
the flesh, and not rather serpents in mind, and three-tongued
malice, and deadliness of touch, and burning with the spirit of
poison? They have truly become vipers, who by their bites
have vomited forth death against the innocent people."</p>

<p>32. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: If I were to say that this is said
of men of character like unto yourselves, you would reply,
"Prove it." What then, have you proved it? Or if you
think that it is proved by the mere fact of its being uttered,
there is no need to repeat the same words. Pronounce the
same judgment against yourselves as coming from us to you.
See you not that I too have proved it, if this amounts to
proof? And yet I would have you learn what is really
meant by proof. For indeed I do not even seek for evidence
from without to enable me to prove you vipers. For be well
assured that this very fact marks in you the nature of vipers,
that you have not in your mouth the foundation of truth, but
the poison of slanderous abuse, as it is written, "The poison of
asps is under their lips."<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> And because this might be said
indiscriminately by any one against any one, as though it
were asked, Under whose lips? he immediately adds, "Their
mouth is full of cursing and bitterness."<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> When, therefore,
you say such things as this against men dispersed throughout
the whole world, of whom you know nothing whatsoever, and
many of whom have never heard the name either of C√¶cilianus
or of Donatus, and when you do not hear them answering
amid silence. Nothing of what you say has reference to us;
we never saw it; we never did it; we are totally at a loss to
understand what you are saying,&mdash;seeing that you desire
nothing else than to say what you are entirely powerless to
prove, how can you help allowing that your mouth is full of
cursing and bitterness? See, therefore, whether you can possibly
show that you are not vipers,<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> unless you show that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Christians throughout all nations of the world are <i>traditors</i>,
and murderers, and anything but Christians. Nay, in very
truth, even though you should be able to know and set before
us the lives and deeds of every individual man throughout
the world, yet before you can do that, seeing that you act as
you do without any consideration, your mouth is that of a
viper, your mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. Show to
us now, if you can, what prophet, what wise man, what scribe
we have slain, or crucified, or scourged in our synagogues.
Look how much labour you have expended without in any
way being able to prove that Donatus and Marculus were
prophets, or wise men, or scribes, because, in fact, they were
nothing of the sort. But even if you could prove as much as
this, what progress would you have made towards proving that
they had been killed by us, when even we ourselves did not
so much as know them? and how much less the whole world,
whom you calumniate with poisonous mouth?<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> Or whence
will you be able to prove that we have a spirit like that of
those who murdered them, when you actually cannot show
that they were murdered by any one at all? Look carefully
to all these points, see whether you can prove any single one
of them either about the whole world, or to the satisfaction of
the whole world,&mdash;in your persevering calumnies against which
you show that the charges are true in you, which you falsely
propagate against the world.</p>

<p>33. Further, even if we should desire to prove you to be
slayers of the prophets, it would be too long a task to collect
the evidence through all the several instances of the slaughter
which your infuriated leaders of the Circumcelliones, and the
actual crowds of men inflamed by wine and madness, not only
have committed since the beginning of your schism, but even
continue to commit at the present time. To take the case
nearest at hand. Let the divine utterances be produced, which
are commonly in the hands of both of us. Let us consider
those to be murderers of the prophets whom we find contradicting
the words of the prophets. What more learned
definition could be given? What could admit of speedier
proof? You would be acting less cruelly in piercing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
bodies of the prophets with a sword, than in endeavouring to
destroy the words of the prophets with your tongue. The
prophet says, "All the ends of the world shall remember and
turn unto the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> Behold and see how this is being
done, how it is being fulfilled. But you not only close your
ears in disbelief against what is said, but you even thrust
out your tongues in madness to speak against what is already
being done. Abraham heard the promise, "In thy seed shall
all the nations of the earth be blessed;"<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> and "he believed,
and it was counted unto him for righteousness."<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> You see
the fact accomplished, and you cry out against it; and you
will not that it should be counted unto you for unrighteousness,
as it fairly would be counted, even if your refusal to
believe was not on the accomplishment, but only on the
utterance of the prophecy. Nay, not only are you not willing
that it should be counted unto you for unrighteousness,
but even what you suffer as the punishment of this impiety
you would fain have counted unto you for righteousness. Or
if your conduct is not a persecution of the prophets, because
your instrument is not the sword but the tongue, what was
the reason of its being said under divine inspiration, "The
sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their
tongue a sharp sword?"<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> But what time would suffice me
to collect from all the prophets all the testimonies to the
Church dispersed throughout the world, all of which you
endeavour to destroy and render nought by contradicting
them? But you are caught; for "their sound is gone out
into all lands, and their words to the end of the world."<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> I
will, however, advance this one saying from the mouth of the
Lord, who is the Witness of witnesses: "All things must be
fulfilled," He says, "which were written in the law of Moses,
and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me." And
what these were let us hear from Himself: "Then opened He
their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures,
and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved
Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third
day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>
See what it is that is written in the law of Moses,
and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning the Lord.
See what the Lord Himself revealed about Himself and about
the Church, making Himself manifest, uttering promises about
the Church. But for you, see that you resist such manifest
proofs as these, and as you cannot destroy them, endeavour to
pervert them, what would you do, if you were to come across
the bodies of the prophets, when you rage so madly against
the utterances of the prophets, as not even to hearken to the
Lord when He is fulfilling, and making manifest, and expounding
the prophets? For do you not, to the utmost of
your power, strive to slay the Lord Himself, since even to
Himself you will not yield?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xv.</span>&mdash;34. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "David also spoke of you
as persecutors in the following terms: 'Their throat is an
open sepulchre; with their tongues have they deceived; the
poison of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of
cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood.
Destruction and unhappiness is in their ways, and the way of
peace have they not known: there is no fear of God before

more false than that which you say, that it is in the party
of Donatus. But the tongues which have deceived are the
tongues of those who, whilst they are acquainted with their
own deeds, not only say that they are just men, but that they
are justifiers of men, which is said of One only "that justifieth
the ungodly,"<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> and that because "He is just and the justifier."<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>
As regards the poison of asps, and the mouth full of cursing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
and bitterness, we have said enough already. But you have
yourselves said that the followers of Maximianus had feet
swift to shed blood, as is testified by the sentence of your
general Council, so often quoted in the records of the proconsular
province and of the state. But they, so far as we
hear, never killed any one in the body. You evidently, therefore,
understood that the blood of the soul was shed in spiritual
murder by the sword of schism, which you condemned in

blood, when you cut off men from the unity of the whole
world, if you were right in saying it of the followers of Maximianus,
because they cut off some from the party of Donatus.
Are we again without the knowledge of the way of peace, who
study to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace?
and yet do you possess that knowledge, who resist the discourse
which Christ held with His disciples after His resurrection,
of so peaceful a nature that He began it with the
greeting, "Peace be unto you;"<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> and that so strenuously that
you are proved to be saying nothing less to Him than this,
"What Thou saidst of the unity of all nations is false; what
we say of the offence of all nations is true?" Who would say
such things as this if they had the fear of God before their
eyes? See, therefore, if in daily saying things like this you
are not trying to destroy the people of God dispersed throughout
the world, eating them up as it were bread.</p>

warns us, saying, 'Beware of false prophets, which come unto
you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves;
and ye shall know them by their fruits.'"<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></p>

<p>37. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: If I were to inquire of you by
what fruits you know us to be ravening wolves, you are sure
to answer by charging us with the sins of other men, and these
such as were never proved against those who are said to have
been guilty of them. But if you should ask of me by what
fruits we know you rather to be ravening wolves, I bring
against you the charge of schism, which you will deny, but
which I will straightway go on to prove; for, as a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
fact, you do not communicate with all the nations of the earth,
nor with those Churches which were founded by the labour of
the apostles. Hereupon you will say, "I do not communicate
with <i>traditors</i> and murderers." The seed of Abraham answers
you, "These are those charges which you made, which are
either not true, or have no reference to me." But these I set
aside for the present; do you meanwhile show me the Church.
Now that voice will sound in my ears which the Lord
showed was to be avoided in the false prophets who made
a show of their several parties, and strove to estrange men
from the Catholic Church, "Lo, here is Christ, or there." But
do you think that the true sheep of Christ are so utterly destitute
of sense, who are told, "Believe it not,"<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> that they will
hearken to the wolf when he says, "Lo, here is Christ," and

preference a mode of deceiving by which he usurps to himself

therefore a marvel if you falsely call yourself a bishop. For even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
those fallen angels, lovers of the maidens of the world, who were
corrupted by the corruption of their flesh, though, from having
stripped themselves of divine excellence, they have ceased to be
angels, yet retain the name of angels, and always esteem themselves
as angels, though, being released from the service of God,
they have passed from the likeness of their character into the
army of the devil, as the great God declares, 'My spirit shall
not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh.'<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> To
those guilty ones and to you the Lord Christ will say, 'Depart
from me, ye cursed ones, into everlasting fire, prepared for the
devil and his angels.'<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> If there were no evil angels, the devil
would have no angels; of whom the apostle says, that in the
judgment of the resurrection they shall be condemned by the
saints: 'Know ye not,' says he, 'that we shall judge angels?'<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>
If they were true angels, men would not have authority to
judge the angels of God. So too those sixty apostles, who,
when the twelve were left alone with the Lord Christ, departed
in apostasy from the faith, are so far yet considered among
wretched men to be apostles, that from them Manich√¶us and
the rest entangle many souls in many devilish sects which
they destroyed<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> that they might take them in their snares.
For indeed the fallen Manich√¶us, if fallen he was, is not to
be reckoned among those sixty, if it be that we can find his
name as an apostle among the twelve, or if he was ordained
by the voice of Christ when Matthias was elected into the
place of the traitor Judas, or another thirteenth like Paul, who
calls himself the last<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> of the apostles, expressly that any one
who was later than himself might not be held to be an apostle.
For these are his words: 'For I am the last of the apostles,
that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted
the Church of God.'<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> And do not flatter yourselves in this:
he was a Jew that had done this. You too, as Gentiles, may
work destruction upon us. For you carry on war without
licence, against whom we may not fight in turn. For you
desire to live when you have murdered us; but our victory is
either to escape or to be slain."</p>

<p>41. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: See how you have quoted the
testimony of holy Scripture, or how you have understood it,
when it has no bearing at all upon the present point at issue.
For all that you have brought forward was simply said to
prove that there are false bishops, just as there are false angels
and false apostles. Now we too know quite well that there are
false angels and false apostles, and, as the true apostle says, false
brethren also;<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> but, seeing that charges such as yours may be
brought by either side against the other, what is required is
a certain degree of proof, and not mere empty words. But
if you would see to which of us the charge of falseness more
truly applies, recall to mind what we have said before, and
you will see it there set forth, that we may not become tedious
to our readers by repeating the same thing over and over
again. And yet how is the Church dispersed throughout the
world affected either by what you may have found to say
about its chaff, which is mixed with it throughout the whole
world; or by what you said of Manich√¶us and the other
devilish sects? For if the wheat is not affected by anything
which is said even about the chaff which is still mingled with
it, how much less are the members of Christ dispersed
throughout the whole world affected by monstrosities<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> which
have been so long and so openly separated from it?<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xix.</span>&mdash;42. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "The Lord Jesus Christ
commands us, saying, 'When they persecute you in this city,
flee ye into another; and if they persecute you in that, flee
yet into a third; for verily I say unto you, ye shall not have
gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.'<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>
If He gives us this warning in the case of Jews and pagans,
you who call yourself a Christian ought not to imitate the
dreadful deeds of the Gentiles. Or do you serve God in such
wise that we should be murdered at your hands? You do
err, you do err, if you are wretched enough to entertain such a
belief as this. For God does not have butchers for His priests."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>43. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: To flee from one state to another
from the face of persecution has not been enjoined as precept
or permission on heretics or schismatics, such as you are; but
it was enjoined on the preachers of the gospel, whom you
resist. And this we may easily prove in this wise: you are
now in your own cities, and no man persecutes you. You
must therefore come forth, and give an account of your
separation. For it cannot be maintained that, as the weakness
of the flesh is excused when it yields before the violence
of persecution, so truth also ought to yield to falsehood.
Furthermore, if you are suffering persecution, why do you not
retire from the cities in which you are, that you may fulfil
the instructions which you quote out of the gospel? But if
you are not suffering persecution, why are you unwilling to
reply to us? Or if the fact be that you are afraid lest, when
you should have made reply, you then should suffer persecution,
in that case how are you following the example of those
preachers to whom it was said, "Behold, I send you forth as
sheep in the midst of wolves?" To whom it was also further
said, "Fear not them which kill the body, but are not
able to kill the soul."<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> And how do you escape the charge of
acting contrary to the injunction of the Apostle Peter, who
says, "Be ready always to give an answer to every man that
asketh you a reason of the faith and hope that is in you?"<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>
And, lastly, wherefore are you ever eager to annoy the Catholic
Churches by the most violent disturbances, whenever it is in
your power, as is proved by innumerable instances of simple
fact? Wherefore in such a case did you not hearken to the
voice of the Lord, when He says, "But I say unto you, that
ye resist not evil?"<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> Or, allowing that it is possible that in
some cases it should be right for violent men to be resisted
by bodily force, and that it does not violate the precept which
we receive from the Lord, "But I say unto you, that ye resist
not evil," why may it not also be that a pious man should
eject an impious man, or a just man him that is unjust, in
the exercise of duly and lawfully constituted authority, from
seats which are unlawfully usurped, or retained to the despite
of God? For you would not say that the false prophets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
suffered persecution at the hands of Elijah, in the same sense
that Elijah suffered persecution from the wickedest of kings?<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>
Or that because the Lord was scourged by His persecutors,
therefore those whom He Himself drove out of the temple
with scourges are to be put in comparison with His sufferings?
It remains, therefore, that we should acknowledge that there
is no other question requiring solution, except whether you
have been pious or impious in separating yourselves from the
communion of the whole world. For if it shall be found
that you have acted impiously, you would not be surprised if
there should be no lack of ministers of God by whom you
might be scourged, seeing that you suffer persecution not from
us, but as it is written, from their own abominations.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

guilty of sacrilege, then a saint cannot be a murderer."</p>

<p>45. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: Defend yourselves from the
charge of the persecution which those men suffered at the
hands of your party who separated themselves from you with
the followers of Maximianus, and therein you will find our
defence. For if you say that you committed no such deeds,
we simply read to you the records of the proconsular province
and the state. If you say that you were right in persecuting
them, why are you unwilling to suffer the like yourselves?
If you say, "But we caused no schism," then let this be
inquired into, and, till it is decided whether it be so or not,
let no one make accusation against persecutors. If you say
that even schismatics ought not to have suffered persecution, I
ask whether it is also the case that they ought not to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
driven out of the basilicas, in which they lay snares for the
leading astray of the weak, even though it were done by duly
constituted authorities? If you say that this also should not
have been done, first restore the basilicas to the followers of
Maximianus, and then discuss the point with us. If you say
that it was right, then see what they ought to suffer at the
hands of duly constituted authority, who, in resisting it, "resist
the ordinance of God." Wherefore the apostle expressly says,
"For he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister
of God, a revenger to execute wrath on him that doeth evil."<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>
But even if this had been discovered after the truth had been
searched out with all diligence, that not even after public
trial ought schismatics to undergo any punishment, or be
driven from the positions which they have occupied, for their
treachery and deceit; and if you should say that you are
vexed that the followers of Maximianus should have suffered
such conduct at the hands of some of you,&mdash;why does not the
wheat of the Lord cry out with the more freedom from the whole
field of the Lord, that is, from the world, and say, Neither are
we at all affected by what the tares and the chaff amongst
us do, seeing that it is contrary to our wish? If you confess
that it is sufficient to clear you of responsibility, that all the
evil that is done by men of your party is done in opposition
to your wishes, why then have you separated yourselves?
For if your reason for not separating from the unrighteous
among the party of Donatus is that each man bears his own
burden, why have you separated yourselves from those throughout
the world whom you think, or profess to think, to be unrighteous?
Is it that you might all share equally in bearing
the burden of schism?</p>

<p>46. And when we ask of you which of your party you
can prove to have been slain by us, I indeed can remember
no law issued by the emperors to the effect that you should
be put to death. Those indeed whose deaths you quote most
frequently to bring us into odium, Marculus and Donatus, present
a great question,&mdash;whether they threw themselves down
a precipice, as your teaching does not hesitate to encourage
by examples of daily occurrence, or whether they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
thrown down by the true command of some authority. For
if it is a thing incredible that the leaders of the Circumcelliones
should have wrought upon themselves a death in accordance
with their custom, how much more incredible it is
that the Roman authorities should have been able to condemn
them to a punishment at variance with custom! Accordingly,
in considering this matter, which you think excessive
in its hatefulness, supposing what you say is true, what is
there in it which bears upon the Lord's wheat? Let the
chaff which flew away outside accuse the chaff which yet
remained within; for it is not possible that it should all be
separated till the winnowing at the last day. But if what
you say is false, what wonder is it if, when the chaff is
carried away as it were by a light blast of dissension, it even
attacks the wheat of the Lord with false accusations? Wherefore,
on the consideration of all such odious accusations, the
wheat of Christ, which is ordered to grow together with the
tares throughout the field, that is, throughout the whole
world, makes this answer to you with a free and fearless
voice: If you cannot prove what you say, it has no application
to any one; and if you prove it, it yet does not apply to
me. The result of which is, that whosoever has separated
himself from the unity of the wheat on account of the offences
chargeable against the tares, or against the chaff, is unable to
defend himself from the charge of murder which is involved
in the mere offence of dissension and schism, as the Scripture
says, "Whoso hateth his brother is a murderer."<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxi.</span>&mdash;47. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "Accordingly, as we have
said, the Lord Christ cried, 'Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
me? It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And
he said, Who art Thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus
of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. And he, trembling and
astonished, said, Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do? And
the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it
shall be told thee what thou must do.' And so presently it
goes on, 'But Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes
were opened, he saw no man.' See here how blindness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
coming in punishment of madness, obscures the light in the
eyes of the persecutor, not to be again expelled except by
baptism! Let us see, therefore, what he did in the city.
'Ananias,' it is said, 'entered into the house to Saul, and
putting his hands on him, said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even
Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest,
hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be
filled with the Holy Ghost. And immediately there fell from
his eyes as it had been scales; and he received sight forthwith,
and arose, and was baptized.'<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> Seeing therefore that
Paul, being freed by baptism from the offence of persecution,
received again his eyesight freed from guilt, why will not
you, a persecutor and <i>traditor</i>, blinded by false baptism, be
baptized by those whom you persecute?"</p>

<p>48. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: You do not prove that I, whom
you wish to baptize afresh, am either a persecutor or a <i>traditor</i>.
And if you prove this charge against any one, yet the persecutor
and <i>traditor</i> is not to be baptized afresh, if he has been
baptized already with the baptism of Christ. For the reason
why it was necessary that Paul should be baptized was that
he had never been washed in any baptism of the kind.
Therefore what you have chosen to insert about Paul has no
point of resemblance with the case which you are arguing
with us. But if you had not inserted this, you would have
found no place for your childish declamation, "See how blindness
comes in punishment of madness, not to be again expelled
except by baptism!" For with how much more force
might one exclaim against you, See how blindness comes in
punishment of madness, which, finding its similitude in
Simon, not in Paul, is not expelled from you even when you
have received baptism? For if persecutors ought to be baptized
by those whom they persecute, then let Primianus be
baptized by the followers of Maximianus, whom he persecuted
with the utmost eagerness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxii.</span>&mdash;49. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "It may be urged that
Christ said to His apostles, as you are constantly quoting
against us, 'He that is washed needeth not save to wash his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
feet, but is clean every whit.' Now if you discuss those words
in all their fulness, you are bound by what immediately follows.
For this is what He said, in His very words: 'He that
is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean
every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. For He knew
who should betray Him; therefore said He, Ye are not all
clean.'<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> Whosoever, therefore, has incurred the guilt of
treason, has forfeited, like you, his baptism. Again, after
that the betrayer of Christ had himself been condemned, He
thus more fully confirmed His words to the eleven apostles:
'Now are ye clean through the word which I have spoken
unto you. Abide in me, and I in you.'<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> And again He said
to these same eleven, 'Peace I leave with you, my peace I
give unto you.'<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> Seeing, then, that these things were said to
the eleven apostles, when the traitor, as we have seen, had
been condemned, you likewise, being <i>traditors</i>, are similarly
without both peace and baptism."</p>

<p>50. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: If therefore every <i>traditor</i> has
forfeited his baptism, it will follow that every one who, having
been baptized by you, has afterwards become a <i>traditor</i>, ought
to be baptized afresh. And if you do not do this, you yourselves
sufficiently prove the falseness of the saying, "Whosoever
therefore has incurred the guilt of treason, has forfeited,
like you, his baptism." For if he has forfeited it, let him
return and receive it again; but if he returns and does not
receive it, it is clear that he had not forfeited it. Again, if
the reason why it was said to the apostles, "Now are ye
clean," and "My peace I give unto you," was that the traitor
had already left the room, then was not that supper of so
great a sacrament clean and able to give peace, which He distributed
to all before his going out? And if you venture to
say this with your eyes closed against the truth, what can we
do save exclaim the more, See how blindness comes in punishment
of the madness of those who wish to be, as the apostle
says, "teachers of the law, understanding neither what they
say, nor whereof they affirm?"<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> And yet, unless blindness
came in the way of their pertinacity, it was not a very difficult
matter that you should understand and see that the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
did not say in the presence of Judas, Ye are not yet clean,
but "Now are ye clean." He added, however, "But not all,"
because there was one there who was not clean; yet if he
had been polluting the others by his presence, it would not
have been declared to them, "Now are ye clean," but, as I
said before, Ye are not yet clean. But, after Judas had gone
out, He said to them, "Now are ye clean," and did not add
the words, But not all, because he had now departed in
whose presence indeed, as had been said to them, they were
already clean, but not all, because there was one there unclean.
Wherefore in these words the Lord rather declared that in
the one company of men receiving the same sacraments, the
uncleanness of some members cannot hurt the clean. Certainly,
if you think that there are among us men like Judas,
you might apply to us the words, "Ye are clean, but not all."
But this is not what you say; but you say that because of
the presence of some who are unclean, therefore we are all
unclean. This the Lord did not say to the disciples in the
presence of Judas, and therefore whoever says this has not
learned from the good Master what He says.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxiii.</span>&mdash;51. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "But if you say that
we give baptism twice over, truly it is rather you who do this,
who slay men who have been baptized; and this we do not
say because you baptize them, but because you cause each
one of them, by the act of slaying him, to be baptized in his
own blood. For the baptism of water or of the Spirit is as
it were doubled when the blood of the martyr is wrung from
him. And so our Saviour also Himself, after being baptized
in the first instance by John, declared that He must be baptized
again, not this time with water nor with the Spirit, but
with the baptism of blood, the cross of suffering, as it is
written, 'James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came unto
Him, saying, Master, we would that Thou shouldest do for us
whatsoever we shall desire. And He said unto them, What
would ye that I should do for you? They said unto Him,
Grant that we may sit, one on Thy right hand, and the other
on Thy left hand, in Thy glory. But Jesus said unto them,
Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
drink of, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized
with? And they said unto Him, We can. And Jesus said
unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of;
and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be
baptized,'<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> and so forth. If these are two baptisms, you commend
us by your malice, we must needs confess. For when
you kill our bodies, then we do celebrate a second baptism;
but it is that we are baptized with our baptism and with
blood, like Christ. Blush, blush, ye persecutors. Ye make
martyrs like unto Christ, who are sprinkled with the baptism
of blood after the water of the genuine baptism."</p>

<p>52. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: In the first place, we reply
without delay that we do not kill you, but you kill yourselves
by a true death, when you cut yourselves off from the living
root of unity. In the next place, if all who are killed are
baptized in their own blood, then all robbers, all unrighteous,
impious, accursed men, who are put to death by the sentence
of the law, are to be considered martyrs, because they are
baptized in their own blood. But if only those are baptized
in their own blood who are put to death for righteousness'
sake, since theirs is the kingdom of heaven,<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> you have
already seen that the first question is why you suffer, and only
afterwards should we ask what you suffer. Why therefore
do you puff out your cheeks before you have shown the
righteousness of your deeds? Why does your tongue resound
before your character is approved? If you have made a
schism, you are impious; if you are impious, you die as one
guilty of sacrilege, when you are punished for impiety; if
you die as one guilty of sacrilege, how are you baptized in
your blood? Or do you say, I have not made a schism?
Let us then inquire into this. Why do you make an outcry
before you prove your case?</p>

<p>53. Or do you say, Even if I am guilty of sacrilege, I ought
not to be slain by you? It is one question as to the enormity
of my action, which you never prove with any truth,
another as to the baptism of your blood, from whence you
derive your boast. For I never killed you, nor do you prove
that you are killed by any one. Nor even if you were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
prove it would it in any way affect me, whoever it was that
killed you, whether he did it justly in virtue of power lawfully
given by the Lord, or committed the crime of murder,
like the chaff of the Lord's harvest, through some evil desire;
just as you are in no way concerned with him who in recent
times, with an intolerable tyranny, attended even by a company
of soldiers, not because he feared any one, but that he
might be feared by all, oppressed widows, destroyed pupils,
betrayed the patrimonies of other men, annulled the marriages
of other men, contrived the sale of the property of the innocent,
divided the price of the property when sold with its
mourning owners. I should seem to be saying all this out of
the invention of my own head, if it were not sufficiently
obvious of whom I speak without the mention of his name.<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>
And if all this is undoubtedly true, then just as you are not
concerned with this, so neither are we concerned with anything
you say, even though it were true. But if that colleague of
yours, being really a just and innocent man, is maligned by a
lying tale, then should we also learn in no way to give credit
to reports, which have been spread abroad of innocent men, as
though they had delivered up the sacred books, or murdered
any of their fellow-men. To this we may add, that I refer to
a man who lived with you, whose birthday you were wont to
celebrate with such large assemblies, with whom you joined
in the kiss of peace in the sacraments, in whose hands you
placed the Eucharist, to whom in turn you extended your
hands to receive it from his ministering, whose ears, when
they were deaf amid the groanings of all Africa, you durst not
offend by free speech; for paying to whom, even indirectly, a
most witty compliment, by saying that in the Count<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> he had a
god for his companion, some one of your party was extolled
to the skies. But you reproach us with the deeds of men
with whom we never lived, whose faces we never saw, in
whose lifetime we were either boys, or perhaps as yet not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
even born. What is the meaning, then, of your great unfairness
and perversity, that you should wish to impose on us the
burdens of those whom we never knew, whilst you will not
bear the burdens of your friends? "When thou sawest a
thief, then thou consentedst with him."<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> If he whom you
saw did not pollute you, why do you reproach me with one
whom I could not have seen? Or do you say, I did not consent
with him, because his deeds were displeasing to me?
But, at any rate, you went up to the altar of God with him.
Come now, if you would defend yourself, make a distinction
between your two positions, and say that it is one thing to
consent together for sin, as the two elders consented together
when they laid a plot against the chastity of Susannah, and
another thing to receive the sacrament of the Lord in company
with a thief, as the apostles received even that first
supper in company with Judas. I am all in favour of your
defence. But why do you not consider how much more
easily, in the course of your defence, you have acquitted all
the nations and boundaries of the earth, throughout which
the inheritance of Christ is dispersed? For if it was possible
for you to see a thief, and to share the sacraments with the
thief whom you saw, and yet not to share his sin, how much
less was it possible for the remotest nations of the earth to
have anything in common with the sins of African <i>traditors</i>
and persecutors, supposing your charges and assertions to be
true, even though they held the sacraments in common with
them? Or do you say, I saw in him the bishop, I did not
see in him the thief? Say what you will. I allow this defence
also, and in this the world is acquitted of the charges
which you brought against it. For if it was permitted you
to ignore the character of a man whom you knew, why
is the whole world not allowed to be ignorant of those it
never knew, unless, indeed, the Donatists are allowed to be
ignorant of what they do not wish to know, while the
nations of the earth may not be ignorant of what they cannot
know?</p>

<p>54. Or do you say, Theft is one thing, delivery of the sacred
books or persecution is another? I grant there is a difference,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
nor is it worth while now to show wherein that difference
consists. But listen to the summary of the argument. If he
could not make you a thief, because his thieving was displeasing
in your sight, who can make men <i>traditors</i> or murderers to
whom such treachery or murder is abhorrent? First, then,
confess that you share in all the evil of Optatus, whom you
knew, and even so reproach me with any evil which was
found in those whom I knew not. And do not say to me,
But my charges are serious, yours but trifling. You must
first acknowledge them, however trifling they may be in your
case, not before I on my side confess the charges against me,
but before I can allow you to say these serious things about
me at all. Did Optatus, whom you knew, make you a thief
by being your colleague, or not? Answer me one or the
other. If you say he did not, I ask why he did not,&mdash;because
he was not a thief himself? or because you do not
know it? or because you disapprove of it? If you say, Because
he himself was not a thief, much more ought we not to
believe that those with whom you reproach us were of such a
character as you assert. For if we must not believe of
Optatus what both Christians and pagans and Jews, ay, and
what both our party and yours assert, how much less should
we believe what you assert of any one? But if you say, Because
you do not know it, all the nations of the earth answer
you, Much more do we not know of all that you reproach us
with in these men. But if you say, Because you disapproved
of it, they answer you with the same voice, Although you
have never proved the truth of what you say, yet acts like
these are viewed by us with disapproval. But if you say,
Lo, Optatus, whom I knew, made me a thief because he was
my colleague, and I was in the habit of going to the altar
with him when he committed those deeds; but I do not
greatly heed it, because the fault was trivial, but your party
made you a <i>traditor</i> and a murderer,&mdash;I answer that I do not
allow that I too am made a <i>traditor</i> and a murderer by the
sins of other men, just because you confess that you are made
a thief by the sin of another man; for it must be remembered
that you are proved a thief, not by our judgment, but by your
own confession. For we say that every man must bear his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
own burden, as the apostle is our witness.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> But you, of your
own accord, have taken the burden of Optatus on your own
shoulders, not because you committed the theft, or consented
to it, but because you declared your conviction that what
another did applied to you. For, as the apostle says, when
speaking of food, "I know, and am persuaded by the Lord
Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that
esteemeth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean;"<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>
by the same rule, it may be said that the sins of others cannot
implicate those who disapprove of them; but if any one
thinks that they affect him, then he is affected by them.
Wherefore you do not convict us of being <i>traditors</i> or murderers,
even though you were to prove something of the sort
against those who share the sacraments with us; but the
guilt of theft is fastened on you, even if you disapprove of
everything that Optatus did, not in virtue of our accusation,
but by your own decision. And that you may not think this
a trivial fault, read what the apostle says, "Nor shall thieves
inherit the kingdom of God."<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> But those who shall not
inherit the kingdom of God will certainly not be on His
right hand among those to whom it shall be said, "Come, ye
blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world." If they are not there,
where will they be except on the left hand? Therefore
among those to whom it shall be said, "Depart from me, ye
cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
angels."<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> In vain, therefore, do you indulge in your security,
thinking it a trivial fault which separates you from the kingdom
of God, and sends you into everlasting fire. How much
better will you do to betake yourself to true confusion, saying,
Every one of us shall bear his own burden, and the winnowing
fan at the last day shall separate the chaff from the wheat!</p>

<p>55. But it is evident that you are afraid of its being forthwith
said to you, "Why then, whilst you attempt to place on
some men's backs the burdens of their neighbours, have you
dared to separate yourselves from the Lord's corn, dispersed
throughout the world, before the winnowing at the last day?"
Accordingly, you who disapprove of the deeds of your party,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
whilst you are taking precautions against being charged with
the schism which you all have made, are involving yourselves
also in their sins which you did not commit; and while the
shrewd Petilianus is afraid of my being able to say that I am
not such as he thinks C√¶cilianus was, he is obliged to confess
that he himself is such as he knows Optatus to have been.
Or are you not such as the common voice of Africa proclaims
him to have been? Then neither are we such as those with
whom you reproach us are either suspected to have been by
your mistake, or calumniously asserted to have been by your
madness, or proved to have been by the truth. Much less is
the wheat of the Lord in all the nations of the earth of such
a character, seeing that it never heard the names of those of
whom you speak. There is therefore no reason why you
should perish in such sin of separation and such sacrilege of
schism. And yet, if you are made to suffer for this great
impiety by the judgment of God, you say that you are even
baptized in your blood; so that you are not content with feeling
no remorse for your division, but you must even glory in
your punishment.</p>

guilt perform what is false, I do not celebrate baptism twice,
which you have never celebrated once."</p>

<p>59. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: In the first place, you do not
convict us of guilt. And if a guilty man baptizes with a false
baptism, then none of those have true baptism who are baptized
by men in your party, that are, I do not say openly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
but even secretly guilty. For if he who gives baptism gives
something that is God's, if he is already guilty in the sight of
God, how can he be giving something that is God's, if a guilty
man cannot give true baptism? But in reality you wait till
he is guilty in your sight as well, as though what he proposes
to confer were something that belonged to you.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxvi.</span>&mdash;60. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "For if you mix what
is false with what is true, falsehood often imitates the truth
by treading in its steps. Just in the same way a picture
imitates the true man of nature, depicting with its colours
the false resemblance of truth. And in the same way, too, the
brilliancy of a mirror catches the countenance, so as to represent
the eyes of him who gazes on it. In this way it presents
to each comer his own countenance, so that the very features
of the comer meet themselves in turn; and of such virtue is
the falsehood of a clear mirror, that the very eyes which see
themselves recognise themselves as though in some one else.
And even when a shadow stands before it, it doubles the reflection,
dividing its unity in great part through a falsehood.
Must we then hold that anything is true, because a lying
representation is given of it? But it is one thing to paint
a man, another to give birth to one. For does any one represent
fictitious children to a man who wishes for an heir? or
would any one look for true heirs in the falsehood of a picture?
Truly it is a proof of madness to fall in love with a
picture, letting go one's hold of what is true."</p>

<p>61. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: Are you then really not
ashamed to call the baptism of Christ a lie, even when it is
found in the most false of men? Far be it from any one to
suppose that the wheat of the Lord, which has been commanded
to grow among the tares throughout the whole field,
that is, throughout the whole of this world, until the harvest,
that is, until the end of the world,<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> can have perished in consequence
of your evil words. Nay, even among the very
tares themselves, which are commanded not to be gathered,
but to be tolerated even to the end, and among the very chaff,
which shall only be separated from the wheat by the winnow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>ing
at the last day,<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> does any one dare to say that any baptism
is false which is given and received in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost? Would you
say that those whom you depose from their office, whether as
your colleagues or your fellow-priests, on the testimony of
women whom they have seduced (since examples of this kind
are not wanting anywhere), were false or true before their
crime was proved against them? You will certainly answer,
False. Why then were they able both to have and to give
true baptism? Why did not their falseness as men corrupt
in them the truth of God? Is it not most truly written,
"For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee deceit?"<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> Seeing
then that the Holy Spirit fled from them, how came it that
the truth of baptism was in them, except because what
the Holy Spirit fled from was the falseness of man, not the
truth of the sacrament? Further, if even the deceitful have
the true baptism, how do they have it who possess it in truthfulness?
Whence you ought to observe that it is rather your
conversation which is coloured with childish pigments; and
accordingly, he who neglects the living Word to take pleasure
in such colouring is himself loving the picture in the place of
the reality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxvii.</span>&mdash;62. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "It will be urged
against us, that the Apostle Paul said, 'One Lord, one faith,
one baptism.'<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> We profess that there is only one; for it is
certain that those who declare that there are two are mad."</p>

<p>63. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> replied: These words of yours are arguments
against yourselves; but in your madness you are not
aware of it. For the men who say there are two baptisms
are those who declare their opinion that the just and the
unjust have different baptisms; whereas it belongs neither to
one party nor the other, but in both of them is one, being
Christ's, although they themselves are not one: and yet the
baptism, which is one, the just have to salvation, the unjust
to their destruction.</p>

be allowed the comparison, it is certain that the sun appears
double to the insane, although it only be that a dark blue
cloud often meets it, and its discoloured surface, being struck
by the brightness, while the rays of the sun are reflected from
it, seems to send forth as it were rays of its own. So in the
same way in the faith of baptism, it is one thing to seek for
reflections, another to recognise the truth."</p>

<p>65. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: What are you saying, if I may
ask? When a dark blue cloud reflects the rays of the sun
with which it is struck, is it only to the insane, and not to all
who look on it, that there appear to be two suns? But when
it appears so to the insane as such, it appears to them alone.
But if I may say so without being troublesome, I would have
you take care lest saying such things and talking in such a
way should be itself a sign of madness. I suppose, however,
that what you meant to say was this,&mdash;that the just had the
truth of baptism, the unjust only its reflection. And if this
be so, I venture to say that the reflection was found in that
man of your party,<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> to whom not God, but a certain Count,<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>
was God; but that the truth was either in you or in him who
uttered the witty saying against Optatus, when he said that
"in the Count he had a god for his companion."<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> And distinguish
between those who were baptized by either of these,
and in the one party approve the true baptism, in the others
exclude the reflection, and introduce the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxix.</span>&mdash;66. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "But to pass rapidly
through these minor points: can he be said to lay down the
law who is not a magistrate of the court? or is what he lays
down to be considered law, when in the character of a private
person he disturbs public rights? Is it not rather the case
that he not only involves himself in guilt, but is held to be a
forger, and that which he composes a forgery?"</p>

<p>67. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: What if your private person,
whom you deem a forger, were to set forth to any one the
law of the emperor? Would not the man, when he had compared
it with the law of those who have the genuine law, and
found it to be identically the same, lay aside all care about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
the source from which he had obtained it, and consider only
what he had obtained? For what the forger gives is false
when he gives it of his own falseness; but when something
true is given by any person, even though he be a forger, yet,
although the giver be not truthful, the gift is notwithstanding
true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxx.</span>&mdash;68. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "Or if any one chance
to recollect the chants of a priest, is he therefore to be deemed
a priest, because with sacrilegious mouth he publishes the
strain of a priest?"</p>

<p>69. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: In this question you are speaking
just as though we were at present inquiring what constituted
a true priest, not what constituted true baptism. For that a
man should be a true priest, it is requisite that he should be
clothed not with the sacrament alone, but with righteousness,
as it is written, "Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness."<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a>
But if a man be a priest in virtue of the sacrament
alone, as was the high priest Caiaphas, the persecutor of the
one most true Priest, then even though he himself be not
truthful, yet what he gives is true, if he gives not what is his
own but what is God's; as it is said of Caiaphas himself,
"This spake he not of himself: but being high priest that
year, he prophesied."<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> And yet, to use the same simile
which you employed yourself: if you were to hear even from
any one that was profane the prayer of the priest couched in
the words suitable to the mysteries of the gospel, can you
possibly say to him, Your prayer is not true, though he himself
may be not only no true priest, but not a priest at all?
seeing that the Apostle Paul said that certain testimony of I
know not what Cretan prophet was true, though he was not
reckoned among the prophets of God; for he says, "One of
themselves, even a prophet of their own, said the Cretians are
always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies: this witness is true."<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>
If, therefore, the apostle even himself bore witness to the
testimony of some obscure prophet of a foreign race, because
he found it to be true, why do not we, when we find in any
one what belongs to Christ, and is true even though the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
with whom it may be found be deceitful and perverse, why
do not we in such a case make a distinction between the fault
which is found in the man, and the truth which he has not of
his own but of God's? and why do we not say, This sacrament
is true, as Paul said, "This witness is true?" Does it
at all follow that we say, The man himself also is truthful,
because we say, This sacrament is true? Just as I would ask
whether the apostle counted that prophet among the prophets
of the Lord, because he confirmed the truth of what he found
to be true in him. Likewise the same apostle, when he was
at Athens, perceived a certain altar among the altars of the
false gods, on which was the inscription, "To the unknown
God." And this testimony he made use of to build them up
in Christ, to the extent of quoting the inscription in his
sermon, and adding, "Whom, therefore, ye ignorantly worship,
Him declare I unto you." Did he, because he found that
altar either among the altars of idols, or set up by sacrilegious
hands, therefore condemn or reject what he found in it that
was true? or did he, because of the truth which he found
upon it, therefore persuade them that they ought also to follow
the sacrilegious practices of the pagans? Surely he did
neither of the two; but presently, when, as he judged fitting,
he wished to introduce to their knowledge the Lord Himself,
unknown to them, but known to him, he says among other
things, that "He is not far from every one of us: for in Him
we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your
own poets have said."<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> Can it be said that here also, because
he found among the sacrilegious the evidence of truth, he
either approved their wickedness because of the evidence,
or condemned the evidence because of their wickedness?
But it is unavoidable that you should be always in the
wrong, so long as you do despite to the sacraments of God
because of the faults of men, or think that we take upon ourselves
the sacrilege even of your schism, for the sake of the
sacraments of God, to which we are unwilling to do despite
in you.</p>

You will never be able to tell us,&mdash;not only because you have

because, even if you did prove this, yet no guilt on the part
of any evil-doers, whether they be unsuspected, or deceitful,

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxii.</span>&mdash;72. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "For although there is
only one baptism, yet it is consecrated in three several grades.
John gave water without the name of the Trinity, as he declared
himself, saying, 'I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance:
but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose
shoes I am not worthy to bear: He shall baptize you with
the Holy Ghost, and with fire.'<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> Christ gave the Holy Spirit,

came on the apostles as a fire burning with rustling flames.
O true divinity, which seemed to blaze, not to burn! as it is
written, 'And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of
a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they
were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues,
like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were
all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other
tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.'<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> But you, O<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
persecutor, have not even the water of repentance, seeing that
you hold the power not of the murdered John, but of the
murderer Herod. You therefore, O <i>traditor</i>, have not the
Holy Spirit of Christ; for Christ did not betray others to death,
but was Himself betrayed. For you, therefore, the fire in the
spirit in Hades is full of life,&mdash;that fire which, surging with
hungry tongues of flame, will be able to burn your limbs to
all eternity without consuming them, as it is written of the
punishment of the guilty in hell, 'Neither shall their fire be
quenched.'"<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a></p>

<p>73. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: You are the calumnious slanderer,
not the truthful arguer. Will you not at length cease
to make assertions of a kind which, if you do not prove them,
can apply to nobody; and even if you prove them, certainly
cannot apply to the unity of the whole world, which is in the
saints as in the wheat of God? If we too were pleased to
return calumnies for calumnies, we too might possibly be able
to give vent to eloquent slanders. We too might use the
expression, "With rustling flames;" but to me an expression
never sounds in any way eloquent which is inappropriate in
its use. We too might say, "Surging with hungry tongues of
flame;" but we do not wish that the tongues of flame in our
writings, when they are read by any one in his senses, should
be judged hungry for want of the sap of weightiness, or that
the reader himself, while he finds in them no food of useful
sentiments, should be left to suffer from the hunger of excessive
emptiness. See, I declare that your Circumcelliones are
burning, not with rustling but with headlong flames. If you
answer, What is that to us? why do not you, when you
reproach with any one whom you will, not listen in turn to
our answer, We too know nothing of it? If you answer, You
do not prove the fact, why may not the whole world answer
you in turn, Neither do you prove it? Let us agree therefore,
if you please, that you should not charge us with the guilt of
the wicked men whom you consider to belong to us, and that
we should abstain from similar charges against you. So you
will see, by this just agreement, confirmed and ratified, that
you have no charge which you can bring against the seed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Abraham, as found in all the nations of the earth. But I find
without difficulty a grievous charge to bring against you: Why
have you impiously separated yourselves from the seed of
Abraham, which is in all nations of the earth? Against this
charge you certainly have no means whereby you may defend
yourselves. For we each of us clear ourselves of the sins of
other men; but this, that you do not hold communion with
all the nations of the earth, which are blessed in the seed of
Abraham, is a very grievous crime, of which not some but all
of you are guilty.</p>

<p>74. And yet you know, as you prove by your quotation,
that the Holy Spirit descended in such wise, that those who
were then filled with it spake with divers tongues: what was
the meaning of that sign and prodigy? Why then is the
Holy Spirit given now in such wise, that no one to whom it
is given speaks with divers tongues, except because that
miracle then prefigured that all nations of the earth should
believe, and that thus the gospel should be found to be in
every tongue? Just as it was foretold in the psalm so long
before: "There is no speech nor language where their voice
is not heard." This was said with reference to those men
who were destined, after receiving the Holy Spirit, to speak
with every kind of tongue. But because this passage itself
signified that the gospel should be found hereafter in all
nations and languages, and that the body of Christ should
sound forth throughout all the world in every tongue, therefore
he goes on to say, "Their sound is gone out throughout all
the earth, and their words to the ends of the world." Hence
it is that the true Church is hidden from no one. And hence
comes that which the Lord Himself says in the gospel, "A
city that is set on an hill cannot be hid."<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> And therefore
David continues in the same psalm, "In the sun hath He
placed His tabernacle," that is, in the open light of day; as
we read in the Book of Kings, "For thou didst it secretly;
but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun."<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>
And He Himself is "as a bridegroom coming out of His chamber,
and rejoiceth as a giant to run His race. His going forth
is from the end of heaven:" here you have the coming of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
Lord in the flesh. "And His circuit unto the ends of it:"
here you have His resurrection and ascension. "And there is
nothing hid from the heat thereof:"<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> here you have the coming
of the Holy Spirit, whom He sent in tongues of fire, that
He might make manifest the glowing heat of charity, which
he certainly cannot have who does not keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace with the Church, which is throughout
all languages.</p>

<p>75. Next, however, with regard to your statement that
there is indeed one baptism,<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> but that it is consecrated in
three several grades, and to your having distributed the three
forms of it to three persons after such fashion, that you
ascribe the water to John, the Holy Spirit to the Lord Jesus
Christ, and, in the third place, the fire to the Comforter sent
down from above,&mdash;consider for a moment in how great an
error you are involved. For you were brought to entertain such
an opinion simply from the words of John: "I indeed baptize
you with water: but He that cometh after me is mightier
than I: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with
fire."<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> Nor were you willing to take into consideration that
the three things are not attributed to three persons taken one
by one,&mdash;water to John, the Holy Spirit to Christ, fire to the
Comforter,&mdash;but that the three should rather be referred to
two persons&mdash;one of them to John, the other two to our
Lord. For neither is it said, I indeed baptize you with water:
but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes
I am not worthy to bear: He shall baptize you with the
Holy Ghost: and the Comforter, who is to come after Him,
He shall baptize you with fire; but "I indeed," He says,
"with water: but He that cometh after me with the Holy
Ghost, and with fire." One he attributes to himself, two to
Him that cometh after him. You see, therefore, how you
have been deceived in the number. Listen further. You said
that there was one baptism consecrated in three stages&mdash;water,
the Holy Spirit, and fire; and you assigned three persons to
the three stages severally&mdash;John to the water, Christ to the
Spirit, the Comforter to the fire. If, therefore, the water of
John bears reference to the same baptism which is com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>mended
as being one, it was not right that those should have
been baptized a second time by the command of the Apostle
Paul whom he found to have been baptized by John. For they
already had water, belonging, as you say, to the same baptism;
so that it remained that they should receive the Holy Spirit
and fire, because these were wanting in the baptism of John,
that their baptism might be completed, being consecrated, as
you assert, in three stages. But since they were ordered to
be baptized by the authority of an apostle, it is sufficiently
made manifest that that water with which John baptized had
no reference to the baptism of Christ, but belonged to another
dispensation suited to the exigencies of the times.</p>

<p>76. Lastly, when you wished to prove that the Holy Spirit
was given by Christ, and had brought forward as a proof from
the gospel, that Jesus on rising from the dead breathed into
the face of His disciples, saying, "Receive ye the Holy
Ghost;"<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> and when you wished to prove that that last fire
which was named in connection with baptism was found in
the tongues of fire which were displayed on the coming of the
Holy Ghost, how came it into your head to say, "And the
Comforter Himself came upon the apostles as a fire burning
with rustling flames," as though there were one Holy Spirit
whom He gave by breathing on the face of His disciples, and
another who, after His ascension, came on the apostles? Are
we to suppose, therefore, that there are two Holy Spirits?
Who will be found so utterly mad as to assert this? Christ
therefore Himself gave the same Holy Spirit, whether by
breathing on the face of the disciples, or by sending Him
down from heaven on the day of Pentecost, with undoubted
commendation of His holy sacrament. Accordingly it was
not that Christ gave the Holy Spirit, and the Comforter gave
the fire, that the saying might be fulfilled, "With the Holy
Spirit, and with fire;" but the same Christ Himself gave the
Holy Spirit in both cases, making it manifest while He was
yet on earth by His breathing, and when He was ascended
into heaven by the tongues of flame. For that you may
know that the words of John, "He shall baptize you with
the Holy Ghost," were not fulfilled at the time when He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
breathed on His disciples' face, so that they should require to
be baptized, when the Comforter should come, not with the
Spirit any longer, but with fire, I would have you remember
the most outspoken words of Scripture, and see what the Lord
Himself said to them when He ascended into heaven: "John
truly baptized you with water; but ye shall be baptized with
the Holy Ghost, whom ye shall receive not many days hence
at Pentecost."<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> What could be plainer than this testimony?
But, according to your interpretation, what He should have
said was this: John verily baptized you with water; but ye
were baptized with the Holy Spirit when I breathed on your
faces; and next in due order shall ye be baptized with fire,
which ye shall receive not many days hence;&mdash;in order that
by this means the three stages should be completed, in which
you say that the one baptism was consecrated. And so it
proves to be the case that you are still ignorant of the meaning
of the words, "He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost,
and with fire;" and you are rash enough to be willing to teach
what you do not know yourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxiii.</span>&mdash;77. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "But that I may
thoroughly investigate the baptism in the name of the Trinity,
the Lord Christ said to His apostles: 'Go ye, and baptize all
nations, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever
I have commanded you.'<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> Whom do you teach, <i>traditor</i>?
Him whom you condemn? Whom do you teach, <i>traditor</i>?
Him whom you slay? Once more, whom do you teach? Him
whom you have made a murderer? How then do you baptize
in the name of the Trinity? You cannot call God your
Father. For when the Lord Christ said, 'Blessed are the
peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God,'<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>
you who have not peace at your heart cannot have God for
your Father. Or how, again, can you baptize in the name of
the Son, who betray that Son Himself, who do not imitate
the Son of God in any of His sufferings or crosses? Or how,
again, can you baptize in the name of the Holy Ghost, when
the Holy Ghost came only on those apostles who were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
guilty of treason? Seeing, therefore, that God is not your
Father, neither are you truly born again with the water of baptism.
No one of you is born perfectly. You in your impiety
have neither father nor mother. Seeing, then, that you are of
such a kind, ought I not to baptize you, even though you
wash yourselves a thousand times, after the similitude of the
Jews, who as it were baptize the flesh?"</p>

<p>78. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: Certainly you had proposed
thoroughly to investigate the baptism in the name of the
Trinity, and you had set us to listen with much attention;
but following, as it would seem, what is the easiest course to
you, how soon have you returned to your customary abuse!
This you carry out with genuine fluency. For you set before
yourself what victims you please, against whom to inveigh with
whatsoever bitterness you please: in the midst of which vast
latitude of discourse you are driven into the greatest straits if
any one does but use the little word, Prove it. For this is what
is said to you by the seed of Abraham; and since in him all
nations of the earth are blessed, they care but little when
they are cursed by you. But yet, since you are treating of
baptism, which you consider to be true when it is found in a
just man, but false when it is found in the unjust, see how
I too, if I were to investigate baptism in the name of the
Trinity according to your rule, might say, with great fulness,
as it seems to me, that he has not God for his father who
in a Count has God for his companion,<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> nor believes that
any is his Christ, save him for whose sake he has endured
suffering; and that he has not the Holy Ghost who burned
the wretched Africa in so very different a fashion with tongues
of fire. How then can they have baptism, or how can they
administer it in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost? Surely you must now perceive that
baptism can exist in an unrighteous man, and be administered
by an unrighteous man, and that no unrighteous baptism, but
such as is just and true,&mdash;not because it belongs to the
unrighteous man, but because it is of God. And herein I
am uttering no calumny against you, as you never cease to
do, on some pretence or other, against the whole world; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
what is even more intolerable, you do not even bring any
proof about the very points on which you found your
calumnies. But I know not how this can possibly be
endured, because you not only bring calumnies against holy
men about unrighteous men, but you even bring a charge
against the holy baptism itself, which must needs be holy in
any man, however unrighteous he may be, from a comparison
with the infection arising from the sins of wicked men, so
that you say that baptism partakes of the character of him
by whom it is possessed, or administered, or received. Furthermore,
if a man partakes of the character of him in whose
company he approaches sacred mysteries, and if the sacraments
themselves partake of the character of the men in
whom they are, holy men may well be satisfied to find consolation
in the thought that they only fare like holy baptism
itself in hearing false accusations from your lips. But it would
be well for you to see how you are condemned out of your own
mouths, if both the sober among you are counted as drunken
from the infection of the drunken in your ranks, and the
merciful among you become robbers from the infection of the
robbers, and whatever evil is found among you in the persons
of wicked men is perforce shared by those who are not
wicked; and if baptism itself is unclean in all of you who
are unclean, and if it is of different kinds according to the
varying character of uncleanness itself, as it must be if it is
perforce of the same character as the man by whom it is
possessed or administered. These suppositions most undoubtedly
are false; and accordingly they in no wise injure us,
when you bring them forward against us without looking back
upon yourselves. But they do injure you, because, when you
bring them forward falsely, they do not fall on us; but, since
you imagine them to be true, they recoil upon yourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxiv.</span>&mdash;79. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "For if the apostles

to baptize men guilty of sacrilege like yourselves?"</p>

<p>80. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: Where then is what you said
above, that there was not one baptism of John and another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
of Christ, but that there was one baptism, consecrated in three
stages, of which three stages John gave the water, Christ the
Spirit, and the Comforter the fire? Why then did the apostles
repeat the water in the case of those to whom John had
already administered water belonging to the one baptism
which is consecrated in three stages? Surely you must see
how necessary it is that every one should understand the
meaning of what he is discussing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxv.</span>&mdash;81. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "Nor indeed will it
be possible that the Holy Spirit should be implanted in the
heart of any one by the laying on of the hands of the priest,
unless the water of a pure conscience has gone before to give
him birth."</p>

<p>82. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: In these few words of yours
two errors are involved; and one of them, indeed, has no
great bearing on the question which is being discussed between
us, but yet it helps to convict you of want of skill. For the
Holy Spirit came upon a hundred and twenty men, without
the laying on of any person's hands, and again upon Cornelius
the centurion and those who were with him, even
before they were baptized.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> But the second error in these
words of yours entirely overthrows your whole case. For
you say that the water of a pure conscience must necessarily
precede to give new birth, before the Holy Spirit can follow on
it. Accordingly, either all the water consecrated in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is water
of a pure conscience, not for the merits of those by whom it
is administered, or by whom it is received, but in virtue of
the stainless merits of Him who instituted this baptism; or
else, if only a pure conscience on the part both of the ministrant
and the recipient can produce the water of a pure conscience,
what do you make of those whom you find to have
been baptized by men who bore a conscience stained with as
yet undiscovered guilt, especially if there exist among the said
baptized persons any one who should confess that he at the
time when he was baptized had a bad conscience, in that he
might possibly have desired to use that opportunity for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
accomplishment of some sinful act? When, therefore, it shall
be made clear to you that neither the man who administered
baptism, nor the man who received it, had a pure conscience,
will you give your judgment that he ought to be baptized afresh?
You will assuredly neither say nor do anything of the sort.
The purity therefore of baptism is entirely unconnected with
the purity or impurity of the conscience either of the giver
or the recipient. Will you therefore dare to say that the
deceiver, or the robber, or the oppressor of the fatherless and
widows, or the sunderer of marriages, or the betrayer, the
seller, the divider of the patrimony of other men,<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> was a man
of pure conscience? Or will you further dare to say that
those were men of pure conscience, whom it is hard to imagine
wanting in such times,&mdash;men who made interest with the man
I have described, that they might be baptized, not for the sake
of Christ, nor for the sake of eternal life, but to conciliate
earthly friendships, and to satisfy earthly desires? Further,
if you do not venture to say that these were men of pure
conscience, then if you find any of their number who have been
baptized, give to them the water of a pure conscience, which
they as yet have not received; and if you will not do this,
then leave off casting in our teeth a matter which you do not
understand, lest you should be forced to answer in reply to us

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxvi.</span>&mdash;83. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "Which Holy Spirit
certainly cannot come on you, who have not been washed even
with the baptism of repentance; but the water of the <i>traditor</i>,
which most truly needs to be repented of, does but work
pollution."</p>

<p>84. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: As a matter of fact, not only
do you not prove us to be <i>traditors</i>, but neither did your
fathers prove that our fathers were guilty of that sin; though,
even if that had been proved, the consequence would have
been that they would not be our fathers, according to your
earlier assertion, seeing that we had not followed their deeds:
yet neither should we on their account be severed from the
companionship of unity, and from the seed of Abraham, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
which all nations of the earth are blessed.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> However, if the
water of Christ be one thing, and the water of the <i>traditor</i>
another, because Christ was not a <i>traditor</i>, why should not
the water of Christ be one thing, and the water of a robber
another, since certainly Christ was not a robber? Do you
therefore baptize again after baptism by your robber, and I
will baptize again after the <i>traditor</i>, who is neither mine nor
yours; or, if one must believe the documents which are produced,
who is both mine and yours; or, if we are to believe
the communion of the whole world rather than the party of
Donatus, who is not mine, but yours. But, by a better and a
sounder judgment, because it is according to the words of the
apostle, every one of us shall bear his own burden;<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> nor is
either that robber yours, if you are not yourselves robbers;
nor does any <i>traditor</i> belong to any one either of us or you,
who is not himself a <i>traditor</i>. And yet we are Catholics,
who, following the spirit of that judgment, do not desert the
unity of the Church; but you are heretics, who, on account
of charges, whether true or false, which you have brought
against certain men, are unwilling to maintain Christian
charity with the seed of Abraham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxvii.</span>&mdash;85. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "But that the truth
of this may be made manifest from the apostles, we are
taught by their actions, as it is written: 'It came to pass that,
while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through
the upper coasts, came to Ephesus: and finding there certain
disciples, he said unto them, Have ye received the Holy
Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have
not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.
And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized?
And they said, Unto John's baptism. Then said Paul, John
verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto
the people, that they should believe on Him which should come
after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. When they heard this,
they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when
Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on
them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
all the men were about twelve.'<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> If, therefore, they were
baptized that they might receive the Holy Ghost, why do not
you, if you wish to receive the Holy Ghost, take measures to
obtain a true renewing, after your falsehoods? And if we
do ill in urging this, why do you seek after us? or, at any
rate, if it is an offence, condemn Paul in the first instance;
which Paul certainly washed off what had already existed,
whereas we in you give baptism which as yet does not exist.
For you do not, as we have often said before, wash with a
true baptism; but you bring on men an ill repute by your
empty name of a false baptism."</p>

<p>86. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: We bring no accusation against
Paul, who gave to men the baptism of Christ because they
had not the baptism of Christ, but the baptism of John,
according to their own reply; for, being asked, Unto what
were ye baptized? they answered, Unto John's baptism; which
has nothing to do with the baptism of Christ, and is neither
a part of it nor a step towards it. Otherwise, either at that
time the water of the baptism of Christ was renewed a second
time, or if the baptism of Christ was then made perfect by
the two waters, the baptism is less perfect which is given now,
because it is not given with the water which was given at
the hands of John. But either one of these opinions it is
impious and sacrilegious to entertain. Therefore Paul gave
the baptism of Christ to those who had not the baptism of
Christ, but only the baptism of John.</p>

<p>87. But why the baptism of John, which is not necessary
now, was necessary at that time, I have already explained;
and the question has no bearing on the point at issue between
us at the present time, except so far as that it may appear
that the baptism of John was one thing, the baptism of Christ
another,&mdash;just as that baptism was a different thing with
which the apostle says that our fathers were baptized in the
cloud and in the sea, when they passed through the Red Sea
under the guidance of Moses.<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> For the law and the prophets
up to the time of John the Baptist had sacraments which
foreshadowed things to come; but the sacraments of our time
bear testimony that that has come already which the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
sacraments foretold should come. John therefore was a foreteller
of Christ nearer to Him in time than all who went before him.
And because all the righteous men and prophets of former times
desired to see the fulfilment of what, through the revelation
of the Spirit, they foresaw would come to pass,&mdash;whence also
the Lord Himself says, "That many prophets and righteous
men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have
not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and
have not heard them,"<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a>&mdash;therefore it was said of John that
he was more than a prophet, and that among all that were
born of women there was none greater than he;<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> because to
the righteous men who went before him it was only granted
to foretell the coming of Christ, but to John it was given
both to foretell Him in His absence and to behold His presence,
so that it should be found that to him was made manifest
what the others had desired. And therefore the sacrament
of his baptism is still connected with the foretelling of Christ's
coming, though as of something very soon to be fulfilled,
seeing that up to his time there were still foretellings of the
first coming of our Lord, of which coming we have now
announcements, but no longer predictions. But the Lord,
teaching the way of humility, condescended to make use of
the sacraments which He found here in reference to the foretelling
of His coming, not in order to assist the operation of
His cleansing, but as an example for our piety, that so He
might show to us with what reverence we ought to receive those
sacraments which bear witness that He is already come, when
He did not disdain to make use of those which foreshadowed
His coming in the future. And John, therefore, though the
nearest to Christ in point of time, and within one year of the
same age with Him, yet, while he was baptizing, went before
the way of Christ who was still to come; for which reason it
was said of him, "Behold, I send my messenger before Thy
face, which shall prepare Thy way before Thee."<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> And he himself
preached, saying, "There cometh one mightier than I after
me."<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> In like manner, therefore, the circumcision on the
eighth day, which was given to the patriarchs, foretold our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
justification, to the putting away of carnal lusts through the
resurrection of our Lord, which took place after the seventh
day, which is the Sabbath-day, on the eighth, that is, the
Lord's day, which fell on the third day after His burial;
yet the infant Christ received the same circumcision of the
flesh, with its prophetic signification. And as the Passover,
which was celebrated by the Jews with the slaying of a lamb,
prefigured the passion of our Lord and His departure from
this world to the Father, yet the same Lord celebrated the
same Passover with His disciples, when they reminded Him
of it, saying, Where wilt Thou that we prepare for Thee to
eat the Passover?<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> so too He Himself also received the
baptism of John, which formed a part of the latest foretelling
of His coming. But as the Jews' circumcision of the flesh is
one thing, and the ceremony which we observe on the eighth
day after persons are baptized is another;<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> and the Passover
which the Jews still celebrate with the slaying of a lamb is
one thing,<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> and that which we receive in the body and blood
of our Lord is another,&mdash;so the baptism of John was one thing,
the baptism of Christ is another. For by the former series
of rites the latter were foretold as destined to arrive; by
these latter the others are declared to be fulfilled. And even
though Christ received the others, yet are they not necessary
for us, who have received the Lord Himself who was foretold
in them. But when the coming of our Lord was as yet
recent, it was necessary for any one who had received the
former that he should be imbued with the latter also; but it
was wholly needless that any one who had been so imbued
should be compelled to go back to the former rites.</p>

<p>88. Wherefore do not seek to raise confusion out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
baptism of John, the source and intention of which was
either such as I have here set forth; or if any other better
explanation of it can be given, this much still is clear, that
the baptism of John and the baptism of Christ are two distinct
and separate things, and that the former was expressly
called the baptism of John, as is clear both from the answer
of those men whose case you quoted, and from the words of
our Lord Himself, when He says, "The baptism of John,
whence was it? from heaven, or of men?"<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> But the latter
is never called the baptism of C√¶cilianus, or of Donatus, or
of Augustine, or of Petilianus, but the baptism of Christ.
For if you think that we are shameless, because we will not
allow that any one should be baptized after baptism from us,
although we see that men were baptized again who had received
the baptism of John, who certainly is incomparably
greater than ourselves, will you maintain that John and
Optatus were of equal dignity? The thing appears ridiculous.
And yet I fancy that you do not hold them to be
equals, but consider Optatus the greater of the two. For
the apostle baptized after baptism by John: you venture to
baptize no one after baptism by Optatus. Was it because
Optatus was in unity with you? I know not with what
heart a theory like this can be maintained, if the friend of
the Count,<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> who had in the Count a god for his companion,
is said to have been in unity, and the friend of the Bridegroom
to have been excluded from it. But if John was pre-eminently
in unity, and far more excellent and greater than
all of us and all of you, and yet the Apostle Paul baptized
after him, why do you then not baptize after Optatus?
Unless indeed it be that your blindness brings you into such
a strait that you should say that Optatus had the power of
giving the Holy Spirit, and that John had not! And if you
do not say this, for fear of being ridiculed for your madness
even by the insane themselves, what answer will you be able
to make when you are asked why men should have required
to be baptized after receiving baptism from John, while no
one needs to be baptized after receiving it from Optatus,
unless it be that the former were baptized with the baptism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
of John, while, whenever any one is baptized with the baptism
of Christ, whether he be baptized by Paul or by Optatus,
there is no difference in the nature of his baptism, though
there is so great a difference between Paul and Optatus?
Return then, O ye transgressors, to a right mind,<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> and do not
seek to weigh the sacraments of God by considerations of the
characters and deeds of men. For the sacraments are holy
through Him to whom they belong; but when taken in hand
worthily, they bring reward, when unworthily, judgment.
And although the men are not one who take in hand the
sacrament of God worthily or unworthily, yet that which is
taken in hand, whether worthily or unworthily, is the same;
so that it does not become better or worse in itself, but only
turns to the life or death of those who handle it in either
case. And in respect of what you said, that "in those whom
Paul baptized after they had received the baptism of John, he
washed off what had already existed," you certainly would not
have said it had you taken a moment to consider what you
were saying. For if the baptism of John required washing
off, it must, beyond all doubt, have had some foulness in it.
Why then should I press you further? Recollect or read, and
see whence John received it, so shall you see against whom you
have uttered that blasphemy; and when you have discovered
this, your heart will surely be beaten, if a rein be not set
on your tongue.</p>

<p>89. To come next to what you think you say against us
with so much point: "If we do ill in urging this, why do
you seek after us?" cannot you even yet call to mind that
only those are sought after who have perished? Or is the
incapacity for seeing this an element in your ruin? For the
sheep might say to the shepherd with equal absurdity, If I do
wrong in straying from the flock, why do you search after me?
not understanding that the very reason why it is being sought
is because it thinks there is no need for seeking it. But who
is there that seeks for you, either through His Scriptures, or
by catholic and conciliatory voices, or by the scourgings of
temporal afflictions, save only Him who dispenses that mercy
to you in all things? We therefore seek you that we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
find you; for we love you that you should have life, with the
same intensity with which we hate your error, that it might
be destroyed which seeks to ruin you, so long as it is not
itself involved in your destruction. And would to God that
we might seek you in such a manner as even to find, and be
able to say with rejoicing of each one of you, "He was dead,
and is alive again; he was lost, and is found!"<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a></p>

Greek equivalent for entire or whole. But it is clear that you
are not in the whole, because you have gone aside into the part."</p>

<p>91. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: I too indeed have attained to a
very slight knowledge of the Greek language, scarcely to be
called knowledge at all, yet I am not shameless in saying
that I know that <i>&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;</i> means not "one," but "the whole;"
and that <i>&kappa;&alpha;&theta;' &omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;</i> means "according to the whole:" whence
the Catholic Church received its name, according to the
saying of the Lord, "It is not for you to know the times and
the seasons, which the Father hath put in His own power.
But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come
upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem,
and in Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost
part of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> Here you have the origin of the name

whole earth,<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> that you actually tell us that we have gone aside
into a part, and are not in the whole among those whose communion
is spread throughout the whole earth. But just in
the same way as, supposing you were to say that I was Petilianus,
I should not be able to find any method of refuting
you unless I were to laugh at you as being in jest, or mourn
over you as being mad, so in the present case I see that I
have no other choice but this; and since I do not believe that
you are in jest, you see what alternative remains.</p>

fellowship of darkness with light, nor any fellowship of bitterness
with the sweet of honey; there is no fellowship of life
with death, of innocence with guilt, of water with blood; the
lees have no fellowship with oil, though they are related to
it as being its dregs, but everything that is reprobate will
flow away. It is the very sink of iniquity; according to the
saying of John, 'They went out from us, but they were not

but if it is truly to be called a part, it will find a suitable
motto in the judgment of Solomon, 'Let their part be cut off
from the earth.'"<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a></p>

<p>93. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: What is it but sheer madness
to utter these taunts without proving anything? You look at
the tares throughout the world, and pay no heed to the wheat,
although both have been bidden to grow together throughout
the whole of it. You look at the seed sown by the wicked
one, which shall be separated in the time of harvest,<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> and you
pay no heed to the seed of Abraham, in which all nations of
the earth shall be blessed.<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> Just as though you were already
a purged mass, and virgin honey, and refined oil, and pure
gold, or rather the very similitude of a whited wall. For, to
say nothing of your other faults, do the drunken form a portion
of the sober, or are the covetous reckoned among the
portion of the wise? If men of gentle temper appropriate
the term of light, where shall the madness of the Circumcelliones
be esteemed to be, excepting in the darkness? Why
then is baptism, given by men like these, held valid among
you, and the same baptism of Christ not held valid, by whatsoever
men it may be administered throughout the world?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
You see, in fact, that you are separated from the communion
of the whole world in so far as this, that you are not indeed
all drunk, nor all of you covetous, nor all men of violence,
but that you are all heretics, and, in virtue of this, are all
impious and all sacrilegious.</p>

<p>94. But as to your saying that the whole world that rejoices
in Christian communion is the party of Macarius, who
with any remnant of sanity in his brain could make such a
statement? But because we say that you are of the party of
Donatus, you therefore seek for a man of whose party you
may say we are; and, being in a great strait, you mention the
name of some obscure person, who, if he is known in Africa,
is certainly unknown in any other quarter of the globe. And
therefore hearken to the answer made to you by all the seed
of Abraham from every corner of the earth: Of that Macarius,
to whose party you assert us to belong, we know absolutely
nothing. Can you reply in turn that you know nothing of
Donatus? But even if we were to say that you are the party
of Optatus, which of you can say that he is unacquainted with
Optatus, unless in the sense that he does not know him personally,
as perhaps he does not know Donatus either? But
you acknowledge that you rejoice in the name of Donatus,
do you also take any pleasure in the name of Optatus?
What then can the name of Donatus profit you, when all of
you alike are polluted by Optatus? What advantage can you
derive from the sobriety of Donatus, when you are defiled by
the drunkenness of the Circumcelliones? What, according
to your views, are you profited by the innocence of Donatus,
when you are stained by the rapacity of Optatus? For this
is your mistake, that you think that the unrighteousness of a
man has more power in infecting his neighbour than the
righteousness of a man has in purifying those around him.
Therefore, if two share in common the sacraments of God, the
one a just man, the other an unrighteous one, but so that
neither the former should imitate the unrighteousness of the
latter, nor the latter the righteousness of the former, you say
that the result is not that both are made just, but that both are
made unrighteous; so that also that holy thing, which both
receive in common, becomes unclean and loses its original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
holiness. When does unrighteousness find for herself such
advocates as these, through whose madness she is esteemed
victorious? How comes it then that, in the midst of such
mistaken perversity, you congratulate yourselves upon the
name of Donatus, when it shows not that Petilianus deserves
to be what Donatus is, but that Donatus is compelled to be
what Optatus is? But let the house of Israel say, "God is
my portion for ever;"<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> let the seed of Abraham say in all
nations, "The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance."<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> For
they know how to speak through the gospel of the glory of
the blessed God. For you, too, through the sacrament which
is in you, like Caiaphas the persecutor of the Lord, prophesy
without being aware of it.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> For what in Greek is expressed
by the word <i>&Mu;&alpha;&kappa;&alpha;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</i> is in our language simply "Blessed;"
and in this way certainly we are of the party of Macarius,
the Blessed One. For what is more blessed than Christ, of
whose party we are, after whom all the ends of the earth are
called, and to whom they all are turned, and in whose sight
all the countries of the nations worship? Therefore the party
of this Macarius, that is to say, of this Blessed One, feels no
apprehension at your last curse, distorted from the words of
Solomon, lest it should perish from the earth. For what is
said by him of the impious you endeavour to apply to the
inheritance of Christ, and you strive to prove that this has
been achieved with inexpressible impiety; for when he was
speaking of the impious, he says, "Let their portion perish
from off the earth."<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> But when you say, with reference to
the words of Scripture, "I shall give Thee the heathen for
Thine inheritance,"<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> and "all the ends of the world shall
remember and turn unto the Lord,"<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> that the promise contained
in them has already perished from the earth, you are
seeking to turn against the inheritance of Christ what was
foretold about the lot of the impious; but so long as the
inheritance of Christ endures and increases, you are perishing
in saying such things. For you are not in every case prophesying
through the sacrament of God, since in this case you
are merely uttering evil wishes through your own madness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>

bids us, 'Be ye not unequally yoked with unbelievers: for

what communion hath light with darkness? and what concord

<p>96. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: I recognise the words of the
apostle; but how they can help you I cannot see at all. For
which of us says that there is any fellowship between righteousness
and unrighteousness, even though the righteous and
the unrighteous, as in the case of Judas and Peter, should be
alike partakers of the sacraments? For from one and the
same holy thing Judas received judgment to himself and
Peter salvation, just as you received the sacrament with
Optatus, and, if you were unlike him, were not therefore partakers
in his robberies. Or is robbery not unrighteousness?
Who would be mad enough to assert that? What fellowship
was there, then, on the part of your righteousness with his
unrighteousness, when you approached together to the same
altar?</p>

ought to have written <i>Augustine answered</i>. But I see what
your object is: you wished, as it were, to preoccupy the
ground, lest we should bring those words in testimony against
you. But what have you really done, except to cause them
to be quoted twice? If, therefore, you are so much pleased
with hearing the words which make against you, as to render
it necessary that they should be repeated, hear, I pray you,
these words as coming from me, Petilianus: Is Christ divided,

<p>102. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: Judas did not die for us, but

vain calumniation when I have a substantial promise. But
if you complain about matters or places appertaining to the
Church, which you used once to hold, and hold no longer,
then the Jews also may say that they are righteous, and
reproach us with unrighteousness, because the Christians now
occupy the place in which of old they impiously reigned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
What then is there unfitting, if, according to a similar will of
the Lord, the Catholics now hold the things which formerly
the heretics used to have? For against all such men as this,
that is to say, against all impious and unrighteous men, those
words of the Lord have force, "The kingdom of God shall be
taken from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth
the fruits thereof;"<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> or is it written in vain, "The righteous
shall eat of the labours of the impious?"<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> Wherefore you ought
rather to be amazed that you still possess something, than that
there is something which you have lost. But neither need you
wonder even at this, for it is by degrees that the whitened
wall falls down. Yet look back at the followers of Maximianus,
see what places they possessed, and by whose agency and
under whose attacks they were driven from them, and do you
venture, if you can, to say that to suffer things like these is
righteousness, while to do them is unrighteousness. In the
first place, because you did the deed, and they suffered them;
and secondly, because, according to the rule of this righteousness,
you are found to be inferior. For they were driven
from the ancient places by Catholic emperors acting through
judges, while you are not even driven forth by the mandates
of the emperors themselves from the basilicas of unity. For
what reason is this, save that you are of less merit, not only
than the rest of your colleagues, but even than those very
men whom you assuredly condemned as guilty of sacrilege by
the mouth of your general Council?</p>

<p>104. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: I also might say, You when
you are infected put on Optatus the betrayer, the robber, the
oppressor, the separater of husband and wife; but far be it
from me that the desire of returning an evil word should
provoke me into any falsehood: for neither do you put on
Optatus, nor we Judas. Therefore, if each one who comes to
us shall answer to our questions that he has been baptized in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>

Christ; and if you baptized any that came from us and said
that they had been baptized in the name of the traitor Judas,
in that case we have no fault to find with what you have
done. But if they had been baptized in the name of Christ,
do you not see what an error you commit in thinking that
the sacraments of God can undergo change through any
changeableness of human sins, or be polluted by defilement
in the life of any man?</p>

walk; the other is for the impious, wherein they shall perish.
And yet, though the designations be alike, there is a great
difference in the reality, that the way of righteousness should
not be defiled by fellowship in a name."</p>

<p>106. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: You have been afraid of the
comparison of your numbers with the multitude throughout
the world; and therefore, in order to win praise for the scantiness
of your party, you have sought to bring in the comparison
of yourself walking in the narrow path. Would to God
that you had betaken yourself not to its praise, but to the
path itself! Truly you would have seen that there was the
same scantiness in the Church of all nations; but that the
righteous are said to be few in comparison with the multitude
of the unrighteous, just as, in comparison with the chaff,
there may be said to be few grains of corn in the most abundant
crop, and yet these very grains of themselves, when
brought into a heap, fill the barn. For the followers of Maximianus
themselves will surpass you in this scantiness of
number, if you think that righteousness consists in this, as
well as in the persecution involved in the loss of places
which they held.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xlvi.</span>&mdash;107. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "In the first Psalm
David separates the blessed from the impious, not indeed
making them into parties, but excluding all the impious from
holiness. 'Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners.' Let him
who had strayed from the path of righteousness, so that he
should perish, return to it again. 'Nor sitteth in the seat
of the scornful.' When he gives this warning, O ye miserable
men, why do you sit in that seat? 'But his delight is
in the law of the Lord; and in His law doth he meditate day
and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers
of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season: his leaf
also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind
driveth away.' He blindeth their eyes, so that they should
not see. 'Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment,
nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. For
the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of
the ungodly shall perish.'"</p>

<p>108. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: Who is there in the Scriptures
that would not distinguish between these two classes of men?
But you in your evil speak indiscriminately, charge the corn
with the offences of the chaff; and being yourselves mere
chaff, you boast yourselves to be the only corn. But the true
prophets declare that both these classes have been mingled
together throughout the whole world, that is, throughout the
whole corn-field of the Lord, until the winnowing which is to
take place on the day of judgment. But I advise you to read
that first Psalm in the Greek version, and then you will not
venture to reproach the whole world with being of the party
of Macarius; because you will perhaps come to understand
of what Macarius there is a party among all the saints, who
throughout all nations are blessed in the seed of Abraham.
For what stands in our language as "Blessed is the man," is
in Greek <i>&Mu;&alpha;&kappa;&alpha;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf; &alpha;&nu;&eta;&rho;</i>]. But that Macarius who offends
you, if he is a bad man, neither belongs to this division, nor
is to its prejudice. But if he is a good man, let him prove
his own work, that he may have glory in himself alone, and
not in another.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xlvii.</span>&mdash;109. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "But the same

my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down

the valley of the shadow of death,'&mdash;though the persecutor, he
means, should slay me,&mdash;'I will fear no evil: for Thou art
with me; Thy rod and Thy staff comfort me.' It was by
this that it conquered Goliath, being armed with the anointing
oil. 'Thou hast prepared a table before me in the presence
of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil;
my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord for ever.'"<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a></p>

<p>110. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: This psalm speaks of those
who receive baptism aright, and use as holy what is so holy.
For those words have no reference even to Simon Magus, who
yet received the same holy baptism; and because he would not
use it in a holy way, he did not therefore pollute it, or show
that in such cases it should be repeated. But since you have
made mention of Goliath, listen to the psalm which treats
of Goliath himself, and see that he is portrayed in a new
song; for there it is said, "I will sing a new song unto Thee,
O God: upon a psaltery, and an instrument of ten strings, will
I sing praise unto Thee."<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> And see whether he belongs to
this song who refuses to communicate with the whole earth.
For elsewhere it is said, "O sing unto the Lord a new song;
sing unto the Lord, all the earth."<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> Therefore the whole
earth, with whom you are not in unity, sings the new song.
And these too are the words of the whole earth, "The Lord
is my shepherd, I shall not want," etc. These are not the
words of the tares, though they be endured until the harvest
in the same crop. They are not the words of the chaff, but of
the wheat, although they are nourished by one and the same
rain, and are threshed out on the same threshing-floor at the
same time, till they shall be separated the one from the other by
the winnowing at the last day. And yet these both assuredly
have the same baptism, though they are not the same themselves.
But if your party also were the Church of God, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
would certainly confess that this psalm has no application to
the infuriated bands of the Circumcelliones. Or if they too
themselves are led through the paths of righteousness, why do
you deny that they are your associates, when you are reproached
with them, although, for the most part, you console yourselves
for the scantiness of your section, not by the rod and staff of
the Lord, but by the cudgels of the Circumcelliones, with which
you think that you are safe even against the Roman laws,&mdash;to
bring oneself into collision with which is surely nothing
less than to walk through the valley of the shadow of death?
But he with whom the Lord is, fears no evils. Surely, however,
you will not venture to say that the words which are sung
in this song belong even to those infuriated men, and yet
you not only acknowledge, but ostentatiously set forth the fact
that they have baptism. These words, therefore, are not used
by any who are not refreshed by the holy water, as are all the
righteous men of God; not by those who are brought to destruction
by using it, as was that magician when baptized by
Philip: and yet the water itself in both kinds of men is the
same, and of the same degree of sanctity. These words are
not used except by those who will belong to the right hand;
but yet both sheep and goats feed in the same pasture under
one Shepherd, until they shall be separated, that they may
receive their due reward. These words are not used except
by those who, like Peter, receive life from the table of the
Lord, not judgment, as did Judas; and yet the supper was
itself the same to both, but it was not of the same profit to
both, because they were not one. These words are not used
except by those who, by being anointed with the sacred oil,
are blessed in spirit also, as was David; not merely consecrated
in the body only, as was Saul: and yet, as they had
both received the same outward sign, it was not the sacrament,
but the personal merit that was different in the two
cases. These words are not used except by those who, with
converted heart, receive the cup of the Lord unto eternal life;
not by those who eat and drink damnation to themselves, as
the apostle says:<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> and yet, though they are not one, the cup
which they receive is one, exerting its power on the martyrs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
that they should obtain a heavenly reward, not on the Circumcelliones,
that they should mark precipices with death.
Remember, therefore, that the characters of bad men in no
wise interfere with the virtue of the sacraments, so that their
holiness should either be destroyed, or even diminished; but
that they injure the unrighteous men themselves, that they
should have them as witnesses of their damnation, not as aids
to health. For beyond all doubt you should have taken into
consideration the actual concluding words of this psalm, and
have understood that, on account of those who forsake the
faith after they have been baptized, it cannot be said by all
who receive holy baptism that "I will dwell in the house of
the Lord for ever:" and yet, whether they abide in the faith,
or whether they have fallen away, though they themselves are
not one, their baptism is one, and though they themselves are
not both holy, yet the baptism in both is holy; because even
apostates, if they return, are not baptized as though they had
lost the sacrament, but undergo humiliation, because they have
done despite to it remaining in them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xlviii.</span>&mdash;111. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "Yet that you
should not call yourselves holy, in the first place, I declare
that no one has holiness who has not led a life of innocence."</p>

<p>112. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: Show us the tribunal where
you have been enthroned as judge, that the whole world
should stand for trial before you, and with what eyes you
have inspected and discussed, I do not say the consciences,
but even the acts of all men, that you should say that the
whole world has lost its innocence. He who was carried up
as far as the third heaven says, "Yea, I judge not mine own
self;"<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> and do you venture to pronounce sentence on the
whole world, throughout which the inheritance of Christ is
spread abroad? In the next place, if what you have said
appears to you to be sufficiently certain, that "no one has
holiness who has not led a life of innocence," I would ask
you, if Saul had not the holiness of the sacrament, what was
in him that David reverenced? But if he had innocence,
why did he persecute the innocent? For it was on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
of the sanctity of his anointing that David honoured him
while alive, and avenged him after he was dead; and because
he cut off so much as a scrap from his garment, he trembled
with a panic-stricken heart. Here you see that Saul had not
innocence, and yet he had holiness,&mdash;not the personal holiness
of a holy life (for that no one can have without innocence),
but the holiness of the sacrament of God, which is holy even
in unrighteous men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xlix.</span>&mdash;113. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "For, granting that
you faithless ones are acquainted with the law, without any
prejudice to the law itself, I may say so much as this, the
devil knows it too. For in the case of righteous Job he
answered the Lord God concerning the law as though he were
himself righteous, as it is written, 'And the Lord said unto
Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is
none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man,
one that feareth God and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth
fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to
destroy him without cause. And Satan answered the Lord,
Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his
life.'<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> Behold he speaks in legal phrase, even when he is
striving against the law. And a second time he endeavoured
thus to tempt the Lord Christ with his discourse, as it is
written, 'The devil taketh Jesus into the holy city, and setteth
Him on a pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto Him, If
thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written,
He shall give His angels charge over thee; and in their hands
they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot
against a stone. Jesus said unto him, It is written again,
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.'<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> You know the

and blushes in his deeds."</p>

<p>114. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: I might indeed ask of you in
what law the words are written which the devil used when
he was uttering calumnies against the holy man Job, if the
position which I am set to prove were this, that you yourself
are unacquainted with the law which you assert the devil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
to have known; but as this is not the question at issue between
us, I pass it by. But you have endeavoured in such
sort to prove that the devil is skilled in the law, as though we
maintained that all who know the law are just. Accordingly,
I do not see in what manner you are assisted by what you
have chosen to quote concerning the devil,&mdash;unless, indeed, it
may be that we should be thereby reminded how you imitate
the devil himself. For as he brought forward the words of
the law against the Author of the law, so you also out of the
words of the law bring accusation against men whom you do
not know, that you may resist the promises of God which
are made in that very self-same law. Then I should be glad
if you would tell me in whose honour do those confessors of
yours achieve their martyrdom, when they throw themselves
over precipices,&mdash;in honour of Christ, who thrust the devil
from Him when he made a like suggestion, or rather in honour
of the devil himself, who suggested such a deed to Christ?
There are two especially vile and customary deaths resorted
to by those who kill themselves,&mdash;hanging and the precipice.
You assuredly said in the earlier part of this epistle, "The
traitor hung himself: he left this death to all who are like
him." This has no application whatever to us; for we refuse
to reverence with the name of martyr any who have strangled
themselves. With how much greater show of reason might
we say against you, That master of all traitors, the devil,
wished to persuade Christ to throw Himself headlong down,
and was repulsed! What, therefore, must we say of those
whom he persuaded with success? What, indeed, except that
they are the enemies of Christ, the friends of the devil, the
disciples of the seducer, the fellow-disciples of the traitor?
For both have learned to kill themselves from the same
master,&mdash;Judas by hanging himself, the others by throwing
themselves over precipices.</p>

that this is no kind of argument, but empty abuse. For this
is what I said a little while ago, You utter the words of the
law, but take no heed against whom you utter them; just as
the devil uttered the words of the law, but failed to perceive
to whom he uttered them. He wished to thrust down our
Head, who was presently to ascend on high; but you wish to
reduce to a small fraction the body of that same Head which
is dispersed throughout the entire world. Certainly you yourself
said a little time before that we know the law, and speak
in legal terms, but blush in our deeds. Thus much indeed
you say without a proof of anything; but even though you
were to prove it of some men, you would not be entitled to
assert it of these others. However, if all men throughout all
the world were of the character which you most vainly charge
them with, what has the chair done to you of the Roman
Church, in which Peter sat, and which Anastasius fills to-day;
or the chair of the Church of Jerusalem, in which James
once sat, and in which John sits to-day, with which we are
united in catholic unity, and from which you have severed
yourselves by your mad fury? Why do you call the apostolic
chair a seat of the scornful? If it is on account of
the men whom you believe to use the words of the law without
performing it, do you find that our Lord Jesus Christ was
moved by the Pharisees, of whom He says, "They say, and
do not," to do any despite to the seat in which they sat? Did
He not commend the seat of Moses, and maintain the honour
of the seat, while He convicted those that sat in it? For He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
says, "They sit in Moses' seat: all therefore whatsoever they
bid you observe, that observe and do; but do ye not after their
works: for they say, and do not."<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> If you were to think of
these things, you would not, on account of men whom you
calumniate, do despite to the apostolic seat, in which you
have no share. But what else is conduct like yours but
ignorance of what to say, combined with want of power to
abstain from evil-speaking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. lii.</span>&mdash;119. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "If you suppose that
you can offer sacrifice, God Himself thus speaks of you as
most abandoned sinners: 'The wicked man,' He says, 'that
sacrificeth a calf is as if he cut off a dog's neck; and he that
offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood.'<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> Recognise
herein your sacrifice, who have already poured out human
blood. And again He says, 'Their sacrifices shall be unto
them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be
polluted.'"<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a></p>

<p>120. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: We say that in the case of
every man the sacrifice that is offered partakes of the character
of him who approaches to offer it, or approaches to partake
of it; and that those eat of the sacrifices of such men,
who in approaching to them partake of the character of those
who offer them. Therefore, if a bad man offer sacrifice to God,
and a good man receive it at his hands, the sacrifice is to each
man of such character as he himself has shown himself to be,
since we find it also written that "unto the pure all things
are pure."<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> In accordance with this true and catholic judgment,
you too are free from pollution by the sacrifice of
Optatus, if you disapproved of his deeds. For certainly his
bread was the bread of mourners, seeing that all Africa was
mourning under his iniquities. But the evil involved in the
schism of all your party makes this bread of mourners common
to you all. For, according to the judgment of your Council,
Felicianus of Musti was a shedder of man's blood. For you
said, in condemning them,<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> "Their feet are swift to shed
blood."<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> See therefore what kind of sacrifice he offers whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
you hold to be a priest, when you have yourselves convicted
him of sacrilege. And if you think that this is in no way to
your prejudice, I would ask you how the emptiness of your
calumnies can be to the prejudice of the whole world?</p>

to God, or utter supplication, it profits you absolutely nothing
whatsoever. For your blood-stained conscience makes your
feeble prayers of no effect; because the Lord God regards
purity of conscience more than the words of supplication,
according to the saying of the Lord Christ, 'Not every one that
saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of
heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in
heaven.'<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> The will of God unquestionably is good, for therefore

<p>122. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: If we on our side were to
utter against you all that you assert against us, would not
any one who heard us consider that we were rather insane
litigants than Christian disputants, if he himself were in his
senses? We do not, therefore, render railing for railing. For
it is not fitting that the servant of the Lord should strive;
but he should be gentle unto all men, willing to learn, in
meekness instructing those that oppose themselves.<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> If, therefore,
we reproach you with those who daily do what is evil
among you, we are guilty of striving unbefittingly, accusing
one for the sins of another. But if we admonish you, that as
you are unwilling that these things should be brought against
yourselves, so you should abstain from bringing against us
the sins of other men, we then in meekness are instructing
you, solely in the hopes that some time you will return to a
better mind.</p>

may be of profit for the salvation of others, even though it be
invoked by sinners! Hence, therefore, you may understand
that when the name of Christ is invoked, the sins of one man
do not stand in the way of the salvation of another. But to
determine in what manner we invoke the name of Christ, we
require not your judgment, but the judgment of Christ Himself
who is invoked by us; for He alone can know in what
spirit He is invoked. Yet from His own words we are
assured that He is invoked to their salvation by all nations,

even so, according to the words of the Lord Himself, 'Many

and in Thy name done many wonderful works? And then

<p>126. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: We acknowledge the word of
the Lord. Hence also the apostle says, "Though I have all
faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity,
I am nothing."<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> Here therefore we must inquire who it is
that has charity: you will find that it is no one else but
those who are lovers of unity. For as to the driving out of
devils, and as to the working of miracles, seeing that very
many do not do such things who yet belong to the kingdom
of God, and very many do them who do not belong to it,
neither our party nor your party have any cause for boasting,
if any of them chance to have this power, since the Lord did
not think it right that even the apostles, who could truly do
such things both to profit and salvation, should boast in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
things like this, when He says to them, "In this rejoice not,
that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because
your names are written in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> Wherefore all
those things which you have advanced from the writings of
the gospel I also might repeat to you, if I saw you working
the powerful acts of signs and miracles; and so might you
repeat them to me, if you saw me doing things of a like sort.
Let us not, therefore, say one to another what may equally be
said on the other side as well; and, putting aside all quibbles,
since we are inquiring where the Church of Christ is to be
found, let us listen to the words of Christ Himself, who redeemed
it with His own blood: "Ye shall be witnesses unto
me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and
unto the uttermost part of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> You see then who
it is with whom a man refuses to communicate who will not
communicate with this Church, which is spread throughout
all the world, if at least you hear whose words these are.
For what is a greater proof of madness than to hold communion
with the sacraments of the Lord, and to refuse to hold
communion with the words of the Lord? Such men at any
rate are likely to say, In Thy name have we eaten and
drunken, and to hear the words, "I never knew you,"<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> seeing
that they eat His body and drink His blood in the sacrament,

<p>132. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: If those are not our opinions
which you hold, neither were they your opinions which you
received from the followers of Maximianus. But if they
were therefore yours, because they were guilty of a sacrilegious
schism in not communicating with the party of Donatus, take
heed what ground you occupy, and with whose inheritance you
refuse communion, and consider what answer you can make,
not to the kings of this world, but to Christ your King. Of
Him it is said, "He shall have dominion also from sea to sea,
and from the river unto the ends of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> From what
river does it mean, save that where He was baptized, and
where the dove descended on Him, that mighty token of
charity and unity? But you refuse communion with this
unity, and occupy as yet the place of unity; and you bring
us into disfavour with the kings of this world in making
use of the edicts of the proconsul to expel your schismatics
from the place of the party of Donatus. These are not mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
words flying at random through the empty void: the men
are still alive, the states bear witness to the fact, the archives
of the proconsuls and of the several towns are quoted in evidence
of it. Let then the voice of calumny be at length silent,
which would bring up against the whole earth the kings of this
world, through whose proconsuls you, yourselves a fragment,
would not spare the fragment which was separated from you.
When then we say that you hold our opinions, we are not
shown to be bearing false witness, unless you can show that
we are not in the Church of Christ, which indeed you never
cease alleging, but never will be able to establish; nay, in real
truth, when you say this, you are bringing a charge of false
witness no longer against us, but against the Lord Himself.
For we are in the Church which was foretold by His own
testimony, and where He bore witness to His witnesses, saying,
"Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and
in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of
the earth." But you show yourselves to be false witnesses
not only from this, that you resist this truth, but also in the
very trial in which you joined issue with the schism of
Maximianus. For if you were acting according to the law of
Christ, how much more consistently do certain Christian
emperors frame ordinances in accordance with it, if even
pagan proconsuls can follow its behests in passing judgment?
But if you thought that even the laws of an earthly empire
were to be summoned to your aid, we do not blame you for
this. It is what Paul did when he bore witness before his
adversaries that he was a Roman citizen.<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> But I would ask
by what earthly laws it is ordained that the followers of
Maximianus should be driven from their place? You will
find no law whatever to this effect. But, in point of fact, you
have chosen to expel them under laws which have been passed
against heretics, and against yourselves among their number.
You, as though by superior strength, have prevailed against
the weak. Whence they, being wholly powerless, say that
they are innocent, like the wolf in the power of the lion.
Yet surely you could not use laws which were passed against
yourselves as instruments against others, except by the aid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
false witness. For if those laws are founded on truth, then
do you come down from the position which you occupy; but
if on falsehood, why did you use them to drive others from
the Church? But how if they both are founded on truth,
and could not be used by you for the expulsion of others
except with the aid of falsehood? For that the judges might
submit to their authority, they were willing to expel heretics
from the Church, from which they ought first to have expelled
yourselves; but you declared yourselves to be Catholics, that
you might escape the severity of the laws which you employed
to oppress others. It is for you to determine what you appear
to yourselves among yourselves; at any rate, under those laws
you are not Catholics. Why then have you either made them
false, if they are true, by your false witness, or made use of
them, if they are false, for the oppression of others?</p>

in possession belong to none other than ourselves, who remain
in unity, not in accordance with the calumnies of men, but
with the words of Christ, in whom all the nations of the
whole earth are blessed. Nor do we separate ourselves from
the society of the wheat, on account of the unrighteous men
whom we cannot separate from the wheat of the Lord before
the winnowing at the judgment; and if there are any things
which you who are cut off begin already to possess, we do
not, because the Lord has given to us what has been taken
away from you, therefore covet our neighbours' goods, seeing
that they have been made ours by the authority of Him to
whom all things belong; and they are rightly ours, for you
were wont to use them for purposes of schism, but we use them
for the promotion of unity. Otherwise your party might reproach
even the first people of God with coveting their neighbours'
goods, seeing that they were driven forth before their face
by the power of God, because they used the land amiss; and
the Jews in turn themselves, from whom the kingdom was taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>

not bear on the question which is at issue between us, I am
not greatly concerned; but when it interferes with the matter
on hand, unless it is quoted truly, then I think that you have
no right to find fault if I remind you how the passage really
stands. For you must be aware that the verse which you
quoted is not as you quoted it, but rather thus: "Whosoever
shall break one of the least of these commandments, and shall
teach men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom of
heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same
shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven." And immediately
He continues, "For I say unto you, That except your
righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and
Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of
heaven."<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> For elsewhere He shows and proves of the Pharisees
that they say and do not. It is these, therefore, to whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
He is referring also here, when He said, "Whosoever shall break
one of these commandments, and shall teach men so,"&mdash;that is,
shall teach in words what he has violated in deeds; whose
righteousness He says that our righteousness must excel, in
that we must both keep the commandments and teach men
so. And yet not even on account of those Pharisees, with whom
you compare us,&mdash;not from any motives of prudence, but from
malice,&mdash;did our Lord enjoin that the seat of Moses should be
deserted, which seat He doubtless meant to be a figure of His
own; for He said indeed that they who sat in Moses' seat
were ever saying and not doing, but warns the people to do
what they say, and not to do what they do,<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> lest the chair,

'Every sin which a man shall sin is without the body: but
he that sinneth in the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven
him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.'"</p>

<p>140. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: This too is not written as you
have quoted it, and see how far it has led you astray. The
apostle, writing to the Corinthians, says, "Every sin that a
man doeth is without the body: but he that committeth fornication
sinneth against his own body."<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> But this is one
thing, and that is another which the Lord said in the gospel:
"All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto
men: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall
not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world
to come."<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> But you have begun a sentence from the writing
of the apostle, and ended it as though it were one from the
gospel, which I fancy you have done not with any intention
to deceive, but through mistake; for neither passage has any
bearing on the matter in hand. And why you have said this,
and in what sense you have said it, I am wholly unable to perceive,
unless it be that, whereas you had said above that all
were condemned by the Lord who had broken any one of His
commandments, you have considered since how many there
are in your party who break not one but many of them; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
lest an objection should be brought against you on that score,
you have sought, by way of surpassing the difficulty, to bring
in a distinction of sins, whereby it might be seen that it is
one thing to break a commandment in respect of which pardon
may easily be obtained, another thing to sin against the Holy
Ghost, which shall receive no forgiveness, either in this world
or in the world to come. In your dread, therefore, of infection
from sin, you were unwilling to pass this over in silence;
and again, in your dread of a question too deep for your
powers, you wish to touch cursorily on it in passing, in such
a state of agitation, that, just as men who are setting about
a task in haste, and consequent confusion, are wont to fasten
their dress or shoes awry, so you have not thought fit either
to see what belongs to what, or in what context or what
sense the passage which you quote occurs. But what is the
nature of that sin which shall not be forgiven, either in this
world or in the world to come, you are so far from knowing,
that, though you believe that we are actually living in it, you
yet promise us forgiveness of it through your baptism. And
yet how could this be possible, if the sin be of such a nature
that it cannot be forgiven, either in this world or in the world
to come?</p>

have not lost heaven and earth, who, in order to avoid communicating
with all the nations of the earth, despise the words
of Him that sitteth in heaven? For, in proof of your meekness,
it is not your words but the cudgels of the Circumcelliones
which should be examined. You will say, What has
that to do with us? Just as though we were making the
remark with any other object except to extract that answer
from you. For the reason that your schism is a valid charge
against you is that you do not allow that you are chargeable
with another's sin, whereas you have separated from us for
no other reason but that you charge us with the sins of other
men.</p>

how many, and with what intensity, the cry of "Praises be to

mourn.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> Do you say again, What is that to us? Then I too
will rejoin again in your own words, What is that to us?
What is it to all the nations of the earth? What is it to
those who praise the name of the Lord from the rising of the
sun to the setting of the same? What is it to all the earth,

the sacrilege of your schism is chargeable on you, just because

and because you are aware from this that the deeds of those
on whose account you separated from the world, even if you
proved your charges to be true, do not involve the world in sin.</p>

that you yourselves are righteous, nor that we inflict
punishment on even the unrighteous; and yet, even as false
flattery is generally cruel, so just correction is ever merciful.
For whence is that which you do not understand: "Let the
righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; and let him reprove
me?" For while he says this of the severity of merciful correction,
the Psalmist immediately went on to say of the gentleness
of destructive flattery, "But the oil of sinners shall not
break my head."<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> Do you therefore consider whither you are
called, and from what you are summoned away. For how do
you know what feelings he entertains towards you whom you
suppose to be cruel? But whatever be his feelings, every one
must bear his own burden both with us and with you. But I
would have you cast away the burden of schism which you
all of you are bearing, that you may bear your good burdens in
unity; and I would bid you mercifully correct, if you should
have the power, all those who are bearing evil burdens; and

pretence of peace by your wickedness, and seek unity by
war."</p>

<p>154. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: We do not make a pretence of
peace by wickedness, but we preach peace out of the gospel;
and if you were at peace with it, you would be at peace also
with us. The risen Lord, when presenting Himself to the
disciples, not only that they should gaze on Him with their
eyes, but also that they should handle Him with their hands,
began His discourse to them with the words, "Peace be unto
you." And how this peace itself was to be maintained, He
disclosed to them in the words which followed. For "then
opened He their understanding, that they might understand
the Scriptures, and said unto them, Thus is it written, and
thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the
third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should
be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a>
If you will keep peace with these words, you
will not be at variance with us. For if we seek unity by war,
our war could not be praised in more glorious terms, seeing
that it is written, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a>

you have unity sought by war, that the body, being subject to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
correction, may be brought under submission. But what the
spirit does against the flesh, waging war with it, not in hatred,
but in love, this those who are spiritual do against those who
are carnal, that they may do towards them what they do
towards themselves, because they love their neighbours as
neighbours indeed. But the war which the spiritual wage is
that correction which is in love: their sword is the word of
God. To such a war they are aroused by the trumpet of the
apostle sounding with a mighty force: "Preach the word; be
instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with
all long-suffering and doctrine."<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> See then that we act not
with the sword, but with the word. But you answer what is
not true, while you accuse us falsely. You do not correct your
own faults, and you bring against us those of other men.
Christ bears true witness concerning the nations of the earth;
you, in opposition to Christ, bear false witness against the
nations of the earth. If we were to believe you rather than
Christ, you would call us peacemakers; because we believe
Christ rather than you, we are said to make a pretence of peace
by our wickedness. And while you say and do such things
as this, you have the further impudence to quote the words,
"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the

anything which may not equally be said against you in turn
by any slanderous and evil-speaking tongue. But from what
has been said by me before, any one who wishes may find
out that these things may be said against you, not by way of
empty abuse, but with the support of truthful testimony. As,
however, the opportunity is presented to us, we must not pass
this by. There is no doubt that to the ancient people of God
circumcision stood in the place of baptism. I ask, therefore,
putting the case that the Pharisees, against whom those words
you quote are spoken, had made some proselyte, who, if he
were to imitate them, would, as it is said, become twofold more
the child of hell than themselves, supposing that he were to
be converted, and desire to imitate Simeon, or Zacharias, or
Nathanael, would it be necessary that he should be circumcised
again by them? And if it is absurd to put this case,
why, although in empty fashion and with empty sounds you
compare us to men like this, do you nevertheless baptize after
us? But if you are really men like this, how much better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
and how much more in accordance with truth do we act in
not baptizing after you, as neither was it right that those
whom I have mentioned should be circumcised after the worst
of Pharisees! Furthermore, when such men sit in the seat of
Moses, for which the Lord preserved its due honour, why do
you blaspheme the apostolic chair on account of men whom,
justly or unjustly, you compare with these?</p>

of the madness of wolves, who either lay or are preparing to
lay snares against the Churches in precisely the same way in
which wolves, with their mouths wide open against the fold,
even with destructive eagerness, breathe forth panting anger
from their jaws, suffused with blood."</p>

<p>164. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: I should be glad to utter the
same sentiment against you, but not in the words which you
have used: they are too inappropriate, or rather mad. But
what was required was, that you should show that we were
wolves and that you were sheep, not by the emptiest of evil-speaking,
but by some distinct proofs. For when I too have
said, We are sheep, and you are wolves, do you think that
there is any difference caused by the fact that you express
the idea in swelling words? But listen whilst I prove what
I assert. For the Lord says in the gospel, as you know full
well, whether you please it or not, "My sheep hear my
voice, and follow me."<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> There are many sayings of the Lord
on different subjects; but supposing, for example, that any
one were in doubt whether the same Lord had risen in the
body, and His words were to be quoted where He says,
"Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as
ye see me have;"&mdash;if even after this he should be unwilling
to acquiesce in the belief that His body had risen from the
dead, surely such a man could not be reckoned among the
sheep of the Lord, because he would not hear His voice. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
so too now, when the question between us is, Where is the
Church? whilst we quote the words that follow in the same
passage of the gospel, where, after His resurrection, He gave
His body even to be handled by those who were in doubt, in
which He showed the future wide extent of the Church, saying,
"Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer,
and to rise from the dead the third day; and that repentance
and remission of sins should be preached in His name throughout
all nations, beginning at Jerusalem;"<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> whereas you will
not communicate with all nations, in whom these words have
been fulfilled, how are you the sheep of this Shepherd, whose
words you not only do not obey when you have heard them,
but even fight against them? And so we show to you from
this that you are not sheep. But listen further whence we
show you that, on the contrary, you are wolves. For necessarily,
when it is shown by His own words where the Church
is to be found, it is also clear where we must look for the
fold of Christ. Whenever, therefore, any sheep separate
themselves from this fold, which is expressly pointed out and
shown to us by the unmistakeable declaration of the Lord,&mdash;and
that, I will not say because of charges falsely brought,
but on account of charges brought, as no one can deny, with
great uncertainty against their fellow-men, and consequently
slay those sheep which they have torn and alienated from the
life of unity and Christian love,&mdash;is it not evident that they
are ravening wolves? But it will be said that these very
men themselves praise and preach the Lord Christ. They
are therefore those of whom He says Himself, "They come
unto you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening
wolves. By their fruits ye shall know them."<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> The sheep's

speaking of those who were with him at the time when he
was writing that epistle; for it could not be that all Christians
in every quarter of the earth were seeking their own,
and not the things which were Jesus Christ's. It was of
those, therefore, as I said, who were with him at the time
when he was writing the words which you have quoted, that
he uttered this lamentation. For who else was it to whom

have been sent forth from our hands, they will fix themselves
in you; if they are aimed by you, they recoil upon yourselves.
For in these apostolic words, which commend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
excellence of charity, we are wont to show to you how profitless
it is to man that he should be in possession of faith or
of the sacraments, when he has not charity, that, when you
come to Catholic unity, you may understand what it is that is
conferred on you, and how great a thing it is of which you were
at least to some extent in want; for Christian charity cannot
be preserved except in the unity of the Church: and that so
you may see that without it you are nothing, even though
you may be in possession of baptism and faith, and through
this latter may be able even to remove mountains. But if
this is your opinion as well, let us not repudiate and reject
in you either the sacraments of God which we know, or faith
itself, but let us hold fast charity, without which we are nothing
even with the sacraments and with faith. But we hold fast
charity if we cling to unity; while we cling to unity, if we
do not make a fictitious unity in a party by our own words,
but recognise it in a united whole through the words of
Christ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. lxxviii.</span>&mdash;173. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "And again,
'Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not;
charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave
itself unseemly, seeketh not her own.' But you seek what
belongs to other men. 'Is not easily provoked, thinketh no
evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
beareth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth.'<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>
This is to say, in short, Charity does not persecute, does not
inflame emperors to take away the lives of other men; does
not plunder other men's goods; does not go on to murder
men whom it has spoiled."</p>

<p>174. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: How often must I tell you the
same thing? If you do not prove these charges, they tell
against no one in the world; and if you prove them, they
have no bearing upon us; just as those things have no bearing
upon you which are daily done by the furious deeds of
the insane, by the luxury of the drunken, by the blindness of
the suicides, by the tyranny of robbers. For who can fail to
see that what I say is true? But now if charity were in you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
it would rejoice in the truth. For how neatly it is said under
covering of the sheep's clothing, "Charity beareth all things,
endureth all things!" but when you come to the test, the
wolf's teeth cannot be concealed. For when, in obedience to
the words of Scripture, "forbearing one another in love, endeavouring
to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
peace,"<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> charity would compel you, even if you knew of any
evils within the Church, I do not say to consent to them, but
yet to tolerate them if you could not prevent them, lest, on
account of the wicked who are to be separated by the winnowing-fan
at the last day, you should at the present time sever
the bond of peace by breaking off from the society of good
men, you, resisting her influence, and being cast out by the
wind of levity, charge the wheat with being chaff, and declare
that what you invent of the wicked holds good through the
force of contagion even in the righteous. And when the
Lord has said, "The field is the world, the harvest is the end
of the world," though He said of the wheat and of the tares,
"Let both grow together until the harvest,"<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> you endeavour
by your words to bring about a belief that the wheat has
perished throughout the main portion of the field, and only
continued to exist in your little corner,&mdash;being desirous that
Christ should be proved a liar, but you the man of truth.
And you speak, indeed, against your own conscience; for no
one who in any way looks truly at the gospel will venture in
his heart to say that in all the many nations throughout
which is heard the response of Amen, and among whom
Alleluia is sung almost with one single voice, no Christians
are to be found. And yet, that it may not appear that the
party of Donatus, which does not communicate with the
several nations of the world, is involved in error, if any
angel from heaven, who could see the whole world, were to
declare that outside your communion good and innocent men
were nowhere to be found, there is little doubt that you would
rejoice over the iniquity of the human race, and boast of
having told the truth before you had received assurance of it.
How then is there in you that charity which rejoices not in
iniquity? But be not deceived. Throughout the field, that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
throughout the world, there will be found the wheat of the
Lord growing till the end of the world. Christ has said
this: Christ is truth. Let charity be in you, and let it rejoice
in the truth. Though an angel from heaven preach
unto you another gospel contrary to His gospel, let him be
accursed.<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. lxxix.</span>&mdash;175. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "Lastly, what is
the justification of persecution? I ask you, you wretched
men, if it so be that you think that your sin rests on any
authority of law."</p>

<p>176. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: He who sins, sins not on the
authority of the law, but against the authority of the law.
But since you ask what is the justification of persecution, I
ask you in turn whose voice it is that says in the psalm,
"Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut
off."<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> Seek therefore the reason or the measure of the persecution,
and do not display your gross ignorance by finding
fault in general terms with those who persecute the
unrighteous.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. lxxx.</span>&mdash;177. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "But I answer you,
on the other hand, that Jesus Christ never persecuted any
one. And when the apostles found fault with certain parties,
and suggested that He should have recourse to persecution (He
Himself having come to create faith by inviting men to Him,
rather than by compelling them), those apostles say, 'Many
lay on hands in Thy name, and are not with us:' but Jesus
said, 'Let them alone: if they are not against you, they are
on your side.'"</p>

<p>178. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: You say truly that you will
bring forth out of your store with greater abundance things
which are not written in the Scriptures. For if you wish
to bring forth proofs from holy Scripture, will you bring forth
even those which you cannot find therein? But it is in your
own power to multiply your lies according to your will. For
where is what you quoted written? or when was that either
suggested to our Lord, or answered by our Lord? "Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
lay on hands in Thy name, and are not with us," are words
that no one of the disciples ever uttered to the Son of God;
and therefore neither could the answer have been made by
Him, "Let them alone: if they are not against you, they are
on your side." But there is something somewhat like it
which we really do read in the gospel,&mdash;that a suggestion was
made to the Lord about a certain man who was casting out
devils in His name, but did not follow Him with His disciples;
and in that case the Lord does say, "Forbid him not: for he
that is not against us is for us."<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> But this has nothing to do
with pointing out parties whom the Lord is supposed to have
spared. And if you have been deceived by an apparent resemblance
of sentiment, this is not a lie, but merely human
infirmity. But if you wished to cast a mist of falsehood over
those who are unskilled in holy Scripture, then may you be
pricked to the heart, and covered with confusion and corrected.
Yet there is a point which we would urge in respect of this
very man of whom the suggestion was made to our Lord.
For even as at that time, beyond the communion of the disciples,
the holiness of Christ was yet of the greatest efficacy, even
so now, beyond the communion of the Church, the holiness of
the sacraments is of avail. For neither is baptism consecrated
save in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost. But who will be so utterly insane as to declare
that the name of the Son may be of avail even beyond the
communion of the Church, but that this is not possible with
the names of the Father and of the Holy Ghost? or that it
may be of avail in healing a man, but not in consecrating
baptism? But it is manifest that outside the communion of
the Church, and the most holy bond of unity, and the most excellent
gift of charity, neither he by whom the devil is cast
out nor he who is baptized obtains eternal life; just as those
do not obtain it, who through communion in the sacraments
seem indeed to be within, and through the depravity of their
character are understood to be without. But that Christ
persecuted even with bodily chastisement those whom He
drove with scourges from the temple, we have already said
above.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. lxxxi.</span>&mdash;179. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "But the holy
apostle said this: 'In any way, whatsoever it may be,' he
says, 'let Christ be preached.'"</p>

<p>180. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: You speak against yourself;
but yet, since you speak on the side of truth, if you love it,
let what you say be counted for you. For I ask of you of
whom it was that the Apostle Paul said this? Let us, if
you please, trace this a little further back. "Some," he says,
"preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good
will. The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing
to add affliction to my bonds; but the other of love,
knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel. What
then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in
truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and
will rejoice."<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> We see that they preached what was in itself
holy, and pure, and true, but yet not in a pure manner, but
of envy and contention, without charity, without purity.
Certainly a short time ago you appeared to be urging the
praises of charity as against us, according to the witness of
the apostle, that where there is no charity, whatever there is is
of no avail; and yet you see that in those there is no charity,
and there was with them the preaching of Christ, of which
the apostle says here that he rejoices. For it is not that he
rejoices in what is evil in them, but in what is good in the
name of Jesus Christ. In him assuredly there was the
charity which "rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the
truth."<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> The envy, moreover, which was in them is an evil
proceeding from the devil, for by this he has both killed and
cast down. Where then were these wicked men whom the
apostle thus condemns, and in whom there was so much
that was good to cause him to rejoice? Were they within, or
without? Choose which you will. If they were within, then
Paul knew them, and yet they did not pollute him. And so
you would not be polluted in the unity of the whole world
by those of whom you make certain charges, whether these be
true, or falsehoods invented by yourselves. But if they were
without, then you see that even in those who were without,
and who certainly cannot belong to everlasting life, since they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
have not charity, and do not abide in unity, there is yet
found the holiness of the name of Christ, so that the apostle
joyfully confirms their teaching, on account of the intrinsic
holiness of the name, although he repudiates them. We are
right, therefore, in not doing wrong to the actual name, when
those come to us who were without; but we correct the individuals,
while we do honour to the name. Do you therefore
take heed, and see how wickedly you act in the case of
those whose acts as it seems you condemn, by treating as
naught the sacrament of the name of Christ, which is holy in
them. And you, indeed, as is shown by your words, think
that those men of whom the apostle spoke were outside the
limits of the Church. Therefore, when you fear persecution
from the Catholics, of which you speak in order to create
odium against us, you have confirmed in heretics the name of
Christ to which you do despite by rebaptizing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. lxxxii.</span>&mdash;181. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "If then there are
not some to whom all this power of faith is found to be in
opposition, on what principle do you persecute, so as to compel
men to defile themselves?"</p>

<p>182. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: We neither persecute you,
except so far as truth persecutes falsehood; nor has it anything
to do with us if any one has persecuted you in other
ways, just as it has nothing to do with you if any of your
party do likewise; nor do we compel you to defile yourselves,
but we persuade you to be cured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. lxxxiii.</span>&mdash;183. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "But if authority
had been given by some law for persons to be compelled to
what is good, you yourselves, unhappy men, ought to have
been compelled by us to embrace the purest faith. But far
be it, far be it from our conscience to compel any one to
embrace our faith."</p>

<p>184. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: No one is indeed to be compelled
to embrace the faith against his will; but by the
severity, or one might rather say, by the mercy of God, it is
common for treachery to be chastised with the scourge of
tribulation. Is it the case, because the best morals are chosen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
by freedom of will, that therefore the worst morals are not
punished by integrity of law? But yet discipline to punish
an evil manner of living is out of the question, except where
principles of good living which had been learned have come
to be despised. If any laws, therefore, have been enacted
against you, you are not thereby forced to do well, but are
only prevented from doing ill.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> For no one can do well
unless he has deliberately chosen, and unless he has loved
what is in free will; but the fear of punishment, even if it
does not share in the pleasures of a good conscience, at any
rate keeps the evil desire from escaping beyond the bounds of
thought. Who are they, however, that have enacted laws by
which your audacity could be repressed? Are they not those
of whom the apostle says that "they bear not the sword in
vain; for they are the ministers of God, revengers to execute
wrath on them that do evil?"<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> The whole question therefore
is, whether you are not doing ill, who are charged by the
whole world with the sacrilege of so great a schism. And yet,
neglecting the discussion of this question, you talk on irrelevant
matters; and while you live as robbers, you boast that you
die as martyrs.<a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> And, through fear either of the laws themselves,
or of the odium which you might incur, or else because
you are unequal to the task of resisting, I do not say so many
men, but so many Catholic nations, you even glory in your
gentleness, that you do not compel any to join your party.
According to your way of talking, the hawk, when he has
been prevented by flight from carrying off the fowls, might
call himself a dove. For when have you ever had the power
without using it? And hence you show how you would do
more if you only could. When Julian, envying the peace of
Christ, restored to you the churches which belonged to unity,
who could tell of all the massacres which were committed by
you, when the very devils rejoiced with you at the opening of
their temples? In the war with Firmus and his party, let
Mauritania C√¶sariensis itself be asked to tell us what the
Moor Rogatus<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> suffered at your hands. In the time of Gildo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
because one of your colleagues<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> was his intimate friend, let
the followers of Maximianus be our witnesses to their sufferings.
For if one might appeal to Felicianus himself, who is
now with you, on his oath, whether Optatus did not compel
him against his will to return to your communion, he would
not dare to open his lips, especially if the people of Musti
could behold his face, who were witnesses to everything that
was done. But let them, as I have said, be witnesses to what
they have suffered at the hands of those with whom they
acted in such wise towards Rogatus. The Catholic Church
herself, though strengthened by the assistance of Catholic
princes ruling by land and sea, was savagely attacked by
hostile troops in arms under Optatus. It was this that first
made it necessary to urge before the vicar Servanus that the
law should be put in force against you which imposes a fine
of ten pounds of gold, which none of you have ever paid to
this very day, and yet you charge us with cruelty. But
where could you find a milder course of proceeding, than that
crimes of such magnitude on your part should be punished by
the imposition of a pecuniary fine? Or who could enumerate
all the deeds which you commit in the places which you hold,
of your own sovereign will and pleasure, each one as he can,
without any friendship on the part of judges or any others in
authority? Who is there of our party, among the inhabitants
of our towns, who has not either learned something of this
sort from those who came before him, or experienced it for
himself? Is it not the case that at Hippo, where I am, there
are not wanting some who remember that your leader Faustinus
gave orders, in the time of his supreme power, in consequence
of the scanty numbers of the Catholics in the place,
that no one should bake their bread for them, insomuch that
a baker, who was the tenant of one of our deacons, threw
away the bread of his landlord unbaked, and though he was
not sentenced to exile under any law, he cut him off from all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
share in the necessaries of life not only in a Roman state,<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a>
but even in his own country, and not only in his own country,
but in his own house? Why, even lately, as I myself recall
with mourning to this day, did not Crispinus of Calama, one
of your party, having bought a property, and that only copyhold,<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a>
boldly and unhesitatingly immerse in the waters of a
second baptism no less than eighty souls, murmuring with
miserable groans under the sole influence of terror; and this
in a farm belonging to the Catholic emperors, by whose laws
you were forbidden even to be in any Roman city?<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> But
what else was it, save such deeds as these of yours, that made
it necessary for the very laws to be passed of which you complain?
The laws, indeed, are very far from being proportionate
to your offences; but, such as they are, you may thank
yourselves for their existence. Indeed, should we not certainly
be driven on all sides from the country by the furious
attacks of your Circumcelliones, who fight under your command
in furious troops, unless we held you as hostages in the
towns, who might well be unwilling to endure under any circumstances
the mere gaze of the people, and the censure of
all honourable men, from very shame, if not from fear? Do
not therefore say, "Far be it, far be it from our conscience,
to force any one to embrace our faith." For you do it when
you can; and when you do not do it, it is because you are
unable, either from fear of the laws or the odium which would
accompany it, or because of the numbers of those who would
resist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. lxxxiv.</span>&mdash;185. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "For the Lord
Christ says, 'No man can come to me, except the Father
which hath sent me draw him.'<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> But why do we not permit
each several person to follow his free will, since the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
God Himself has given free will to men, showing to them,
however, the way of righteousness, lest any one by chance
should perish from ignorance of it? For He said, 'I have
placed before thee good and evil. I have set fire and water
before thee: stretch forth thine hand unto whether thou wilt.'
From which choice, you wretched men, you have chosen for
yourselves not water, but rather fire. 'But yet,' He says,
'stretch forth thine hand unto the good, that thou mayest
live.'<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> You who will not choose the good, have, by your own
sentence, declared that you do not wish to live."</p>

<p>186. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: If I were to propose to you
the question how God the Father draws men to the Son,
when He has left them to themselves in freedom of action,
you would perhaps find it difficult of solution. For how does
He draw them to Him if He leaves them to themselves, so
that each should choose what he pleases? And yet both
these facts are true; but this is a truth which few have intellect
enough to penetrate. As therefore it is possible that,
after leaving men to themselves in free will, the Father should
yet draw them to the Son, so is it also possible that those
warnings which are given by the correction of the laws do not
take away free will. For whenever a man suffers anything
that is harsh and unpleasing, he is warned to consider why it
is that he is suffering, so that, if he shall discover that he is
suffering in the cause of justice, he may choose the good that
consists in the very act of suffering as he does in the cause of
justice; but if he sees that it is unrighteousness for which he
suffers, he may be induced, from the consideration that he is
suffering and being tormented most fruitlessly, to change his
purpose for the better, and may at the same time escape both
the fruitless annoyance and the unrighteousness itself, which
is likely to prove yet more hurtful and pernicious in the mischief
it produces. And so you, when kings make any enactments
against you, should consider that you are receiving a
warning to consider why this is being done to you. For if it
is for righteousness' sake, then are they truly your persecutors;
but you are the blessed ones, who, being persecuted for righteousness'
sake, shall inherit the kingdom of heaven:<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> but if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
is because of the iniquity of your schism, what are they more
than your correctors; while you, like all the others who are
guilty of various crimes, and pay the penalty appointed by
the law, are undoubtedly unhappy both in this world and in
that which is to come? No one, therefore, takes away from
you your free will. But I would urge you diligently to consider
which you would rather choose,&mdash;whether to live corrected
in peace, or, by persevering in malice, to undergo real punishment
under the false name of martyrdom. But I am addressing
you just as though you were suffering something proportionate
to your sin, whereas you are committing sins of such enormity
and reigning in such impunity. You are so furious, that you
cause more terror than a war trumpet with your cry of "<i>Praise
to God</i>;" so full of calumny, that even when you throw yourselves
over precipices without any provocation, you impute it
to our persecutions.</p>

<p>187. He says also, like the kindest of teachers, "You who
will not choose the good, have, by your own sentence, declared
that you do not wish to live." According to this, if we were
to believe your accusations, we should live in kindness; but
because we believe the promises of God, we declare by our
own sentence that we do not wish to live. You remember
well, it seems to me, what the apostles answered to the Jews
when they were desired to abstain from preaching Christ.
This therefore we also say, that you should answer us whether
we ought rather to obey God or man.<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> <i>Traditors</i>, offerers of
incense, persecutors: these are the words of men against men.
Christ remained only in the love of Donatus: these are the
words of men extolling the glory of a man under the name of
Christ, that the glory of Christ Himself may be diminished.
For it is written, "In the multitude of people is the king's
honour: but in the want of people is the destruction of the
prince:"<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> these, therefore, are the words of men. But those
words in the gospel, "It behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise

forth the glory which He received from His Father in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
wideness of His kingdom. When we have heard them both,
we choose in preference the communion of the Church, and
prefer the words of Christ to the words of men. I ask, who
is there that can say that we have chosen what is evil, except
one who shall say that Christ taught what was evil?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. lxxxv.</span>&mdash;188. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "Is it then the case
that God has ordered the massacre even of schismatics? and
if He were to issue such an order at all, you ought to be slain
by some barbarians and Scythians, not by Christians."</p>

<p>189. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: Let your Circumcelliones remain
quiet, and let me entreat you not to terrify us about
barbarians. But as to whether we or you are schismatics, let
the question be put neither to you nor to me, but to Christ,
that He may show where His Church is to be found. Read
the gospel then, and there you find the answer, "In Jerusalem,
and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part
of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> If any one, therefore, is not found within the

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. lxxxvi.</span>&mdash;190. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "For neither has
the Lord God at any time rejoiced in human blood, seeing that
He was even willing that Cain, the murderer of his brother,
should continue to exist in his murderer's life."</p>

<p>191. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: If God was unwilling that
death should be inflicted on him who slew his brother, preferring
that he should continue to exist in his murderer's life,
see whether this be not the cause why, seeing that the heart
of the king is in the hand of God, whereby he has himself
enacted many laws for your correction and reproof, yet no law
of the king has commanded that you should be put to death,
perhaps with this very object, that any one of you who persists
in the obstinate self-will of his sacrilegious madness
should be tortured with the punishment of the fratricide Cain,
that is to say, with the life of a murderer. For we read that
many were slain in mercy by Moses the servant of the Lord;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
for in that he prayed thus in intercession to the Lord for
their wicked sacrilege, saying, "O Lord, if Thou wilt forgive
their sin&mdash;; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of the book
which Thou hast written,"<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> his unspeakable charity and mercy
are plainly shown. Could it be, then, that he was suddenly
changed to cruelty, when, on descending from the mount, he
ordered so many thousands to be slain? Consider, therefore,
whether it may not be a sign of greater anger on the part of
God, that, whilst so many laws have been enacted against you,
you have not been ordered by any emperor to be put to death.
Or do you think that you are not to be compared to that
fratricide? Hearken to the Lord speaking through His prophet:
"From the rising of the sun, even unto the going down
of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and
in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and
a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the
heathen, saith the Lord of hosts."<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> On this brother's sacrifice
you show that you look with malignant eyes, over and above
the respect which God pays to it; and if ye have ever heard
that "from the rising of the sun, unto the going down of the
same, the Lord's name is to be praised,"<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> which is that living
sacrifice of which it is said, "Offer unto God thanksgiving,"<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>
then will your countenance fall like that of yonder murderer.
But inasmuch as you cannot kill the whole world, you are
involved in the same guilt by your mere hatred, according to
the words of John, "Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer."<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a>
And I would that any innocent brother might rather
fall into the hands of your Circumcelliones, to be murdered
by their weapons, than be subjected to the poison of your
tongue and rebaptized.</p>

therefore, if so be that you will hear it willingly, and even
though you do not willingly receive it, yet we warn you that
the Lord Christ instituted for Christians, not any form of slaying,
but one of dying only. For if He loved men who thus delight
in battle, He would not have consented to be slain for us."</p>

<p>193. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: Would that your martyrs would
follow the form that He prescribed! they would not throw
themselves over precipices, which He refused to do at the
bidding of the devil.<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> But when you persecute our ancestors
with false witness even now that they are dead, whence have
you received this form? In that you endeavour to stain us
with the crimes of men we never knew, while you are unwilling
that the most notorious misdeeds of your own party
should be reckoned against you, whence have you received
this form? But we are too much yielding to our own conceit
if we find fault about ourselves, when we see that you utter
false testimony against the Lord Himself, since He Himself
both promised and made manifest that His Church should
extend throughout all nations, and you maintain the contrary.
This form, therefore, you did not receive even from the Jewish
persecutors themselves; for they persecuted His body while
He was walking on the earth: you persecute His gospel as
He is seated in heaven. Which gospel endured more meekly
the flames of furious kings than it can possibly endure your
tongues; for while they blazed, unity remained, and this it
cannot do amid your words. They who desired that the word
of God should perish in the flames did not believe that it
could be despised if read. They would not, therefore, set their
flames to work upon the gospel, if you would let them use
your tongues against the gospel. In the earlier persecution
the gospel of Christ was sought by some in their rage, it was
betrayed by others in their fear; it was burned by some in
their rage, it was hidden by others in their love; it was
attacked, but none were found to speak against its truth. The
more accursed share of persecution was reserved for you when
the persecution of the heathen was exhausted. Those who
persecuted the name of Christ believed in Christ: now those
who are honoured for the name of Christ are found to speak
against His truth.</p>

the fullest possible proof that a Christian may take no part in
the destruction of another. But the first establishing of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
principle was in the case of Peter, as it is written, 'Simon
Peter having a sword, drew it, and smote the high priest's
servant, and cut off his right ear. Then said Jesus unto Peter,
Put up thy sword into the sheath. F or all they that take the
sword shall perish with the sword.'"<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a></p>

<p>195. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: Why then do you not restrain
the weapons of the Circumcelliones with such words as these?
Should you think that you were going beyond the words of
the gospel if you should say, All they that take the cudgel
shall perish with the cudgel? Withhold not then your
pardon, if our ancestors were unable to restrain the men by
whom you complain that Marculus was thrown down a precipice;
for neither is it written in the gospel, He that useth
to throw men down a precipice shall be cast therefrom. And
would that, as your charges are either false or out of date, so
the cudgels of those friends of yours would cease! And yet,
perhaps, you take it ill that, if not by force of law, at any
rate in words, we take away their armour from your legions
in saying that they manifest their rage with sticks alone.
For that was the ancient fashion of their wickedness, but now
they have advanced too far. For amid their drunken revellings,
and amid the free licence of assembling together, wandering
in the streets, jesting, drinking, chambering in company
with women who have no husbands, they have learned not
only to brandish cudgels, but to wield swords and whirl slings.
But why should I not say to them (God knows with what
feelings I say it and with what feelings they receive it!), Madmen,
the sword of Peter, though drawn from motives not yet
free from fleshly impurity, was yet drawn in defence of the
body of Christ against the body of His persecutor, but your
arms are portioned out against the cause of Christ; but the
body of which He is the head, that is, His Church, extends
throughout all nations? He Himself has said this, and has
ascended into heaven, whither the fury of the Jews could not
follow Him; and it is your fury which attacks His members
in the body, which on His ascension He commended to our
care. In defence of those members all men rage against you,
all men resist you, as many as being in the Catholic Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
and possessing as yet but little faith, are influenced by the
same motives as Peter was when he drew his sword in the
name of Christ. But there is a great difference between your
persecution and theirs. You are like the servant of the Jews'
high priest; for in the service of your princes you arm yourselves
against the Catholic Church, that is, against the body
of Christ. But they are such as Peter then was, fighting even
with the strength of their bodies for the body of Christ, that
is, the Church. But if they are bidden to be still, as Peter
then was bidden, how much more should you be warned that,
laying aside the madness of heresy, you should join the unity
of those members for which they so fight? But, being wounded
by such men as these, you hate us also; and, as though you
had lost your right ears, you do not hear the voice of Christ
as He sits at the right hand of the Father. But to whom
shall I address myself, or how shall I address myself to them,
seeing that in them I find no time wherein to speak? for even
early in the morning they are reeking with wine, drunk, it
may be already in the day, it may be still from overnight.
Moreover, they utter threats, and not they only, but their own
bishops utter threats concerning them, being ready to deny
that what they have done has any bearing on them. May the
Lord grant to us a song of degrees, in which we may say,
"My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. I am
for peace: but when I speak, they are for war."<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> For thus

to do with the kings of this world, in whom Christianity has

you shortly the truth of what I say: A king persecuted
the brethren of the Maccabees.<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> A king also condemned
the three children to the sanctifying flames, being ignorant
what he did, seeing that he himself was fighting against God.<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a>
A king sought the life of the infant Saviour.<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> A king exposed

Hence it is that the apostle cries out, 'We speak wisdom
among them that are perfect; yet not the wisdom of this
world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:
but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the
hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto
our glory; which none of the princes of this world knew:
for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord
of glory.'<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> But grant that this was said of the heathen kings
of old. Yet you, rulers of this present age, because you desire
to be Christians, do not allow men to be Christians, seeing
that, when they are believing in all honesty of heart, you
draw them by the defilement and mist of your falsehood
wholly over to your wickedness, that with their arms, which
were provided against the enemies of the state, they should
assail the Christians, and should think that, at your instigation,
they are doing the work of Christ if they kill us whom
you hate, according to the saying of the Lord Christ: 'The time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
cometh,' He says, 'that whosoever killeth you will think that
he doeth God service.'<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> It makes no matter therefore to you,
false teachers, whether the kings of this world desire to be
heathens, which God forbid, or Christians, so long as you
cease not in your efforts to arm them against the family of
Christ. But do you not know, or rather, have you not read,
that the guilt of one who instigates a murder is greater than
the guilt of him who carries it out? Jezebel had excited the
king her husband to the murder of a poor and righteous man,
yet husband and wife alike perished by an equal punishment.<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a>
Nor indeed is your mode of urging on kings different from
that by which the subtle persuasion of women has often urged
kings on to guilt. For the wife of Herod earned and obtained
the boon by means of her daughter, that the head of John
should be brought to table in a charger.<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> Similarly the Jews
forced on Pontius Pilate that he should crucify the Lord
Jesus, whose blood Pilate prayed might remain in vengeance
upon them and on their children.<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> So therefore you also
overwhelm yourselves with our blood by your sin. For it
does not follow that because it is the hand of the judge that
strikes the blow, your calumnies therefore are not rather guilty
of the deed. For the prophet David says, speaking in the
person of Christ, 'Why do the heathen rage, and the people
imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves,
and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord,
and against His Anointed, saying, Let us break their bands
asunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sitteth
in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in
derision. Then shall He speak unto them in His wrath, and
vex them in His sore displeasure. Yet have I set my King
upon my holy hill of Zion. I will declare the decree: the
Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I
begotten Thee. Ask of me, and I shall give Thee the heathen
for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for
Thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron;
Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.' And
he warned the kings themselves in the following precepts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
that they should not, like ignorant men devoid of understanding,
seek to persecute the Christians, lest they should themselves
be destroyed,&mdash;which precepts I would that we could
teach them, seeing that they are ignorant of them; or, at
least, that you would show them to them, as doubtless you
would do if you desired that they should live; or, at any rate,
if neither of the other courses be allowed, that your malice
would have permitted them to read them for themselves. The
first Psalm of David would certainly have persuaded them
that they should live and reign as Christians; but meanwhile
you deceive them, so long as they entrust themselves to you.
For you represent to them things that are evil, and you hide
from them what is good. Let them then at length read this,
which they should have read already long ago. For what does
he say, 'Be wise now therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye
judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice
with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and ye
perish from the way, when His wrath is kindled but a little.
Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him.'<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> You urge
on emperors, I say, with your persuasions, even as Pilate,
whom, as we showed above, the Jews urged on, though he
himself cried aloud, as he washed his hands before them all,
'I am innocent of the blood of this just person,'<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a>&mdash;as though
a person could be clear from the guilt of a sin who had himself
committed it. But, to say nothing of ancient examples,
observe, from instances taken from your own party, how very
many of your emperors and judges have perished in persecuting
us. To pass over Nero, who was the first to persecute
the Christians, Domitian perished almost in the same way as
Nero, as also did Trajan, Geta,<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> Decius, Valerian, Diocletian;
Maximian also perished, at whose command that men should
burn incense to their gods, burning the sacred volumes, Marcellinus
indeed first, but after him also Mensurius of Carthage,
and C√¶cilianus, escaped death from the sacrilegious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
flames, surviving like some ashes or cinders from the burning.
For the consciousness of the guilt of burning incense involved
you all, as many as agreed with Mensurius. Macarius
perished, Ursacius<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> perished, and all your counts perished in
like manner by the vengeance of God. For Ursacius was
slain in a battle with the barbarians, after which birds of prey
with their savage talons, and the greedy teeth of dogs with
their biting, tore him limb from limb. Was not he too a
murderer at your suggestion, who, like king Ahab, whom we
showed to have been persuaded by a woman, slew a poor and
righteous man?<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> So you too do not cease to murder us,
who are just and poor (poor, that is, in worldly wealth; for in
the grace of God no one of us is poor). For even if you do
not murder a man with your hands, you do not cease to do
so with your butcherous tongues. For it is written, 'Death
and life are in the power of the tongue.'<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> All, therefore, who
have been murdered, you, the instigator of the deed, have
slain. Nor indeed does the hand of the butcher glow save
at the instigation of your tongue; and that terrible heat of
the breast is inflamed by your words to take the blood of
others,&mdash;blood that shall take a just vengeance upon him who
shed it."</p>

that it is rather you who have been guilty of this offence by
speaking as you have done, than myself by answering as I
shall do. And first of all, see how you yourself oppose yourself;
for certainly you prefaced the passage which you quoted
with the words, "What have you to do with the kings of this
world, in whom Christianity has never found anything save
envy towards her?" In these words you certainly cut off
from us all access to the kings of this world. And a little
later you say, "And he warned the kings themselves in the
following precepts, that they should not, like ignorant men
devoid of understanding, seek to persecute the Christians, lest
they should be themselves destroyed,&mdash;which precepts I would
that we could teach them, seeing that they are ignorant of
them; or, at least, that you would show them to them, as
doubtless you would do if you desired that they should live."
In what way then do you wish us to be the instructors of
kings? And indeed those of our body who have any friendship
with Christian kings commit no sin if they make a right
use of that friendship; but if any are elated by it, they yet
sin far less grievously than you. For what had you, who thus
reproach us,&mdash;what had you to do with a heathen king, and
what is worse, with Julian, the apostate and enemy of the
name of Christ, to whom, when you were begging that the
basilicas should be restored to you as though they were your
own, you ascribed this meed of praise, "that in him justice
alone was found to have a place?"&mdash;in which words (for I
believe that you understand the Latin tongue) both the
idolatry and the apostasy of Judas are styled justice. I hold
in my hands the petition which your ancestors presented;
the memorial<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> which embodied their request; the chronicles,
where they made their representation. Watch and attend. To
the enemy of Christ, to the apostate, the antagonist of Chris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>tians,
the servant of the devil, that friend, that representative,
that Pontius of yours, made supplication in such words
as these: "Go to then, and say to us, What have you to do
with the kings of this world?" that as deaf men you may
read to the deaf nations what you as well as they refuse to
hear: "Thou beholdest the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye."<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a></p>

<p>204. "What," say you, "have you to do with the kings of
this world, in whom Christianity has never found anything
save envy towards her?" Having said this, you endeavoured
to reckon up what kings the righteous had found to be their
enemies, and did not consider how many more might be enumerated
who have proved their friends. The patriarch Abraham
was both most friendly treated, and presented with a token
of friendship, by a king who had been warned from heaven
not to defile his wife.<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> Isaac his son likewise found a king
most friendly to him.<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> Jacob, being received with honour by
a king in Egypt, went so far as to bless him.<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> What shall I
say of his son Joseph, who, after the tribulation of a prison,
in which his chastity was tried as gold is tried in the fire,
being raised by Pharaoh to great honours,<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> even swore by the
life of Pharaoh,<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a>&mdash;not as though puffed up with vain conceit,
but being not unmindful of his kindness. The daughter of a
king adopted Moses.<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> David took refuge with a king of
another race, compelled thereto by the unrighteousness of the
king of Israel.<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> Elijah ran before the chariot of a most
wicked king,&mdash;not by the king's command, but from his own
loyalty.<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> Elisha thought it good to offer of his own accord to
the woman who had sheltered him anything that she might
wish to have obtained from the king through his intercession.<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a>
But I will come to the actual times when the people of God
were in captivity, in which, to use a mild expression, a strange
forgetfulness came over you. For, wishing to prove that
Christianity has never found anything in kings saving envy
towards her, you made mention of the three children and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
Daniel, who suffered at the hands of persecuting kings, and
you could not derive instruction from circumstances not occurring
near, but in the very same passages, viz. from the conduct
of the king himself after the miracle of the flames which
did no hurt, whether as shown in praising and setting forth
the name of God, or in honouring the three children themselves,
or from the esteem in which the king held Daniel, and
the gifts with which he honoured him, nothing loth to receive
them, when he, rendering the honour that was due to the
king's power, as sufficiently appears from his own words, did
not hesitate to use the gift with which he was endowed by
God, in interpreting the king's dream. And when, in consequence,
the king was compelled by the men who envied the
holy prophet, and heaped calumnies upon him with sacrilegious
madness, most unwillingly to cast him into the den of
lions, sadly though he did it, yet he had the conviction that
he would be safe through the help and protection of his God.
Accordingly, when Daniel, by the miraculous repression of
the lions' rage, had been preserved unhurt, when the friendly
voice of the king spoke first to him in accents of anxiety,
he himself replied with benediction from the den, "O king,
live for ever!"<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> How came it that, when your argument was
turning on the very same subject, when you were yourself
quoting the examples of the servants of God in whose case
these things were done, you either failed to see, or were unwilling
to see, or seeing and knowing, were silent, in a manner
which I know not how you will defend, about those instances
of friendship felt by kings for the saints? But if it were not
that, as a defender of the basest cause, you are hindered by
the desire of building up falsehood, and thereby turned away
either as unwilling or as ignorant from the light of truth,
there can be no doubt that you could, without any difficulty,
recall some good kings as well as some bad ones, and some
friendly to the saints as well as some unfriendly. And we
cannot but wonder that your Circumcelliones thus throw themselves
from precipices. Who was running after you, I pray?
What Macarius, what soldier was pursuing you? Certainly
none of our party thrust you into this abyss of falsehood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
Why then did you thus run headlong with your eyes shut, so
that when you said, "What have you to do with the kings of
this world?" you did not add, In whom Christianity has
often found envy towards herself, instead of boldly venturing
to say, "In whom Christianity has never found anything save
envy towards her?" Was it really true that you neither
thought yourself, nor considered that those who read your
writings would think, how many instances of kings there
were that went against your views? Does he not know
what he says?</p>

<p>205. Or do you think that, because those whom I have
mentioned belonged to olden times, therefore they form no
argument against you, because you did not say, In whom
<i>righteousness</i> has never found anything save envy towards
her, but "In whom <i>Christianity</i> has never found anything
saving envy towards her,"&mdash;meaning, perhaps, that it should
be understood that they began to show envy towards the
righteous from the time when they began to bear the name of
Christians? What then is the meaning of those examples
from olden times, by which you even more imprudently wished
to prove what you had so imprudently ventured to assert?
For was it not before Christ was born inf the world that the
Maccabees, and the three children, and Daniel, did and suffered
what you told of them? And again, why was it, as I
asked just now, that you offered a petition to Julian, the undoubted
foe of Christianity? Why did you seek to recover
the basilicas from him? Why did you declare that only
righteousness found a place with him? If it is the foe of
Christianity that hears such things as these, what then are
they from whom he hears them? But it should be observed
that Constantine, who was certainly no foe to the name of
Christian, but rather rendered glorious by it, being mindful of
the hope which he maintained in Christ, and deciding most
justly on behalf of His unity, was not worthy to be acknowledged
by you, even when you yourselves appealed to him.
Both these were emperors in Christian times, but yet not both
of them were Christians. But if both of them were foes of
Christianity, why did you thus appeal to one of them? why
did you thus present a petition to the other? For on your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
ancestors making their petition, Constantine had given an
episcopal judgment both at Rome and at Arles; and yet the
first of them you accused before him, from the other you
appealed to him. But if, as is the case, one of them had believed
in Christ, the other had apostatized from Christ, why is
the Christian despised while furthering the interests of unity,
the apostate praised while favouring deceit? Constantine
ordered that the basilicas should be taken from you, Julian
that they should be restored. Do you wish to know which
of these actions is conducive to Christian peace? The one
was done by a man who had believed in Christ, the other by
one who had abandoned Christ. O how you would wish that
you could say, It was indeed ill done that supplication should
so be made to Julian; but what has that to do with us? But
if you were to say this, the Catholic Church would also conquer
in these same words, whose saints dispersed throughout the
world are much less concerned with what you say of those towards
whom you feel as you may be disposed to feel. But it
is beyond your power to say, It was ill done that supplication
should so be made to Julian. Your throat is closed; your tongue
is checked by an authority close at home. It was Pontius that
did it. Pontius presented the petition; Pontius declared that
the apostate was most righteous; Pontius set forth that only
righteousness found a place with the apostate. That Pontius
made a petition to him in these words, we have the express
evidence of Julian himself, mentioning him by name, without
any disguise. Your representations still exist. It is no uncertain
rumour, but public documents that bear witness to the
fact. Can it be, that because the apostate made some concession
to your prayer, to the detriment of the unity of Christ,
you therefore find truth in what was said, that only righteousness
found a place with him? but because Christian emperors
decide against your wishes, since this appears to them most
likely to contribute to the unity of Christ, therefore they are
called the foes of Christianity? Such folly may all heretics
display; and may they regain wisdom, so that they should be
no longer heretics.</p>

<p>206. And when is that fulfilled, you will say, which the
Lord declares, "The time cometh, that whosoever killeth you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
will think that he doeth God service?"<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> At any rate, neither
can this be said of the heathen, who persecuted Christians,
not for the sake of God, but for the sake of their idols. You
do not see that if this had been said of these emperors
who rejoice in the name of Christian, their chief command
would certainly have been this, that you should have been put
to death; and this command they never gave at all. But the
men of your party, by opposing the laws in hostile fashion,
bring deserved punishment on themselves; and their own voluntary
deaths, so long as they think that they bring odium on
us, they consider in no wise ruinous to themselves. But if
they think that that saying of Christ refers to kings who
honour the name of Christ, let them ask what the Catholic
Church suffered in the East, when Valens the Arian was
emperor. There indeed I might find what I should understand
to be sufficient fulfilment of the saying of the Lord,
"The time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that
he doeth God service," that heretics should not claim, as conducing
to their especial glory, the injunctions issued against
their errors by Catholic emperors. But we remember that
that time was fulfilled after the ascension of our Lord, of
which holy Scripture is known by all to be a witness. The
Jews thought that they were doing a service to God when
they put the apostles to death. Among those who thought
that they were showing service to God was even our Saul,
though not ours as yet; so that among his causes for confidence
which were past and to be forgotten, he enumerates
the following: "An Hebrew," he says, "of the Hebrews; as
touching the law, a Pharisee; concerning zeal, persecuting
the Church."<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> Here was one who thought that he did God
service when he did what presently he suffered himself. For
forty Jews bound themselves by an oath that they would slay
him, when he caused that this should be made known to the
tribune, so that under the protection of a guard of armed men
he escaped their snares.<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> But there was no one yet to say to
him, What have you to do (not with kings, but) with tribunes
and the arms of kings? There was no one to say to him,
Dare you seek protection at the hand of soldiers, when your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
Lord was dragged by them to undergo His suffering? There
were as yet no instances of madness such as yours; but there
were already examples being prepared, which should be sufficient
for their refutation.</p>

<p>207. Moreover, with what terrible force did you venture
to set forth and utter the following: "But to say nothing of
ancient examples, observe, from instances taken from your
own party, how very many of your emperors and judges have
perished in persecuting us." When I read this in your letter,
I waited with the most earnest expectation to see what you
were going to say, and whom you were going to enumerate,
when, lo and behold! as though passing them over, you began
to quote to me Nero, Domitian, Trajan, Geta, Decius, Valerian,
Diocletian, Maximian. I acknowledge that there were more;
but you have altogether forgotten against whom you are arguing.
Were not all of these pagans, persecuting generally
the Christian name on behalf of their idols? Be vigilant,
then; for the men whom you mention were not of our communion.
They were persecuting the whole aggregate of unity
itself, from which we, as you think, or you, as Christ teaches,
have gone forth. But you had proposed to show that our
emperors and judges had perished in consequence of persecuting
you. Or is it that you yourself do not require that we
should reckon these, because, in mentioning them, you passed
them over, saying, "To pass over Nero;" and with this reservation
did you mean to run through all the rest? What then
was the use of their being quoted, if they had nothing to do
with the matter? But what has it to do with me? I now
join with you in leaving these. Next, let that larger number
which you promised to us be produced, unless, indeed, it may
be that they cannot be found, inasmuch as you said that they
had perished.</p>

<p>208. For now you go on to make mention of the bishops
whom you are wont to accuse of having delivered up the
sacred books, concerning whom we on our part are wont to
answer: Either you fail in your proof, and so it concerns no
one at all; or you succeed, and then it still has no concern
with us. For they have borne their own burden, whether it
be good or bad; and we indeed believe that it was good. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
of whatever character it was, yet it was their own; just as
your bad men have borne their own burden, and neither you
theirs nor they yours. But the common and most evil burden
of you all is schism. This we have already often said before.
Show us, therefore, not the names of bishops, but the names
of our emperors and judges, who have perished in persecuting
you. For this is what you had proposed, this is what you had
promised, this is what you had caused us most eagerly to expect.
"Hear," he says, "Macarius perished, Ursacius perished,
and all your counts perished in like manner, by the vengeance
of God." You have mentioned only two by name, and neither
of them was emperor. Who would be satisfied with this, I
ask? Are you not utterly dissatisfied with yourself? You
promise that you will mention a vast number of emperors and
judges of our party who perished in persecuting you; and
then, without a word of emperors, you mention two who were
either judges or counts. For as to what you add, "And all
your counts perished in like manner by the vengeance of God,"
it has nothing to do with the matter. For on this principle
you might some time ago have closed your argument, without
mentioning the name of any one at all. Why then have you
not made mention of our emperors, that is to say, of emperors
of our communion? Were you afraid that you should be
indicted for high treason? Where is the fortitude that marks
the Circumcelliones? And further, what do you mean by introducing
those whom you mentioned above in such numbers?
They might with more right say to you, Why did you seek
out us? For they did nothing to assist your cause, and yet
you mentioned them by name. What kind of man, then, must
you be, who fear to mention those by name, who, as you say,
have perished? At any rate, you might mention more of the
judges and counts, of whom you seem to feel no fear. But
yet you stopped at Macarius and Ursacius. Are these two
whom you mention the vast number of whom you spoke?
Are you thinking of the lesson which we learned as boys?
For if you were to ask of me what number two is, singular or
plural, what could I answer, except that it was plural? But
even so I am still not without the means of reply. I take
away Macarius from your list; for you certainly have not told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
us how he perished. Or do you maintain that any one who
persecutes you, unless he be immortal on the face of this
earth, is to be deemed when he dies to have died because of
you? What if Constantine had not lived to enjoy so long a
reign, and such prolonged prosperity, who was the first to pass
many decrees against your errors? And what if Julian, who
gave you back the basilicas, had not been so speedily snatched
away from life?<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> In that case, when would you make an end
of talking such nonsense as you do, seeing that even now you
are unwilling to hold your tongues? And yet neither do we
say that Julian died so soon because he gave back the basilicas
to you. For we might be equally prolix with you in this,
but we are unwilling to be equally foolish. Well, then, as I
had begun to say, from these two we will take away Macarius.
For when you had mentioned the names of two, Macarius and
Ursacius, you repeated the name of Ursacius with the view
of showing us how he deserved his death; and you said,
"For Ursacius was slain in a battle with the barbarians, after
which birds of prey with their savage talons, and the greedy
teeth of dogs with their biting, tore him limb from limb."
Whence it is quite clear, since it is your custom to excite
greater odium against us on account of Macarius, insomuch
that you call us not Ursacians but Macarians, that you would
have been sure to say by far the most concerning him, had
you been able to say anything of the sort about his death.
Of these two, therefore, when you used the plural number,
if you take away Macarius, there remains Ursacius alone, a
proper name of the singular number. Where is therefore the
fulfilment of your threatening and tremendous promise of so
many who should support your argument?</p>

<p>209. By this time all men who are in any degree acquainted
with the meaning of words must understand, it seems to me,
how ridiculous it is that, when you had said, "Macarius
perished, Ursacius perished, and all your counts perished in
like manner, by the vengeance of God," as though men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
calling upon you to prove the fact, whereas, in reality, neither
hearer nor reader was calling on you for anything further
whatsoever, you immediately strung together a long argument
in order to prove that all our counts perished in like manner
by the vengeance of God. "For Ursacius," you say, "was
slain in a battle with the barbarians, after which birds of prey
with their savage talons, and the greedy teeth of dogs with
their biting, tore him limb from limb." In the same way, any
one else, who was similarly ignorant of the meaning of what he
says, might assert that all your bishops perished in prison by
the vengeance of God; and when asked how he could prove
this fact, he might at once add, For Optatus, having been
accused of belonging to the company of Gildo, was put to death
in a similar way. Frivolous charges such as these we are
compelled to listen to, to consider, to refute; only we are apprehensive
for the weak, lest, from the greater slowness of their
intellect, they should fall speedily into your toils. But Ursacius,
of whom you speak, if it be the case that he lived a good life,
and really died as you assert, will receive consolation from the
promise of God, who says, "Surely your blood of your lives
will I require: at the hand of every beast will I require it."<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a></p>

<p>210. But as to the calumnious charges which you bring
against us, saying that by us the wrath of the kings of the
world is excited against you, so long as we do not teach
them the lesson of holy Scripture, but rather suggest our own
desire of war, I do not imagine that you are so absolutely
deaf to the eloquence of the sacred books themselves as that
you should not rather fear that they should be acquainted with
it. But whether you so will or no, they gain entrance to the
Church; and even if we hold our tongues, they give heed to
the readers: and, to say nothing of the rest, they especially
listen with the most marked attention to that very psalm which
you quoted. For you said that we do not teach them, nor, so
far as we can help it, allow them to become acquainted with
the words of Scripture: "Be wise now therefore, O ye kings;
be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear,
and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest He be angry,"<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a>
etc. Believe that even this is sung, and that they hear it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
But, at any rate, they hear what is written above in the same
psalm, which you, unless I am mistaken, were only unwilling
to pass over, for fear you should be understood to be afraid.
They hear therefore this as well: "The Lord hath said unto
me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of
me, and I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance,
and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession."<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> On
hearing which, they cannot but marvel that some should be
found to speak against this inheritance of Christ, endeavouring
to reduce it to a little corner of the earth; and in their marvel
they perhaps ask, on account of what they hear in what follows,
"Serve the Lord with fear," wherein they can serve Him, in
so far as they are kings. For all men ought to serve God,&mdash;in
one sense, in virtue of the condition common to them all, in
that they are men; in another sense, in virtue of their several
gifts, whereby this man has one function on the earth, and
that man has another. For no man, as a private individual,
could command that idols should be taken from the earth,
which it was so long ago foretold should come to pass.<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a>
Accordingly, when we take into consideration the social condition
of the human race, we find that kings, in the very fact
that they are kings, have a service which they can render to
the Lord in a manner which is impossible for any who have
not the power of kings.</p>

<p>211. When, therefore, they think over what you quote, they
hear also what you yourself quoted concerning the three children,
and hear it with circumstances of marvellous solemnity.
For that same Scripture is most of all sung in the Church at
a time when the very festal nature of the season excites additional
fervour even in those who, during the rest of the year,
are more given to be sluggish. What then do you think must
be the feelings of Christian emperors, when they hear of the
three children being cast into the burning fiery furnace because
they were unwilling to consent to the wickedness of worshipping
the image of the king,<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> unless you suppose that they con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>sider
that the pious liberty of the saints cannot be overcome
either by the power of kings, or by any enormity of punishment,
and that they rejoice that they are not of the number
of those kings who used to punish men that despised idols as
though they were guilty of sacrilege? But, further, when they
hear in what follows that the same king, terrified by the marvellous
sight of, not only the three children, but the very flames
performing service unto God, himself too began to serve God
in fear, and to rejoice with reverence, and to learn submission,
do they not understand that the reason that this was recorded,
and set forth with such publicity, was that an example might be
set both before the servants of God, to prevent them from committing
sacrilege in obedience to kings, and before kings themselves,
that they should show themselves religious by belief in
God? Being willing, therefore, on their part, from the admonition
of the very psalm which you yourself inserted in your
writings, both to be wise, and to receive instruction, and to
serve God with fear, and to rejoice unto Him with reverence,
and to learn submission, with what attention do they listen to
what that king said afterwards! For he said that he would
make a decree for all the people over whom he ruled, that
whosoever should speak blasphemy against the God of Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego should perish, and their house be
utterly destroyed. And if they know that he made this decree
that blasphemy should not be uttered against the God who
tempered the force of the fire, and liberated the three children,
they surely go on to consider what decrees they ought to make
in their kingdom, that the same God who has granted remission
of sins, and given freedom to the whole earth, should not
be treated with scorn among the faithful in their realm.</p>

<p>212. See therefore, when Christian kings make any decree
against you in defence of Catholic unity, that it be not the
case that with your lips you are accusing them of being unlearned,
as it were, in holy Scripture, while in your hearts you
are grieving that they are so well acquainted with its teaching.
For who could put up with the sacrilegious and hateful fallacy
which you advance in the case of one and the same Daniel, to
find fault with kings because he was cast into the den of lions,
and to refuse praise to kings in that he was raised to exalted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
honour, seeing that, even when he was cast into the den of
lions, the king himself was more inclined to believe that he
would be safe than that he would be destroyed, and, in anxiety
for him, refused to eat his food? And then do you dare to
say to Christians, "What have you to do with the kings of the
world?" because Daniel suffered persecution at a king's hands,
and yet not look back upon the same Daniel faithfully interpreting
dreams to kings, calling a king lord, receiving gifts and
honours from a king? And so again do you dare, in the case
of the aforesaid three children, to excite the flames of odium
against kings, because, when they refused to worship the
statue, they were cast into the flames, while at the same
time you hold your tongue, and say nothing about their being
thus extolled and honoured by the king? Granted that the
king was a persecutor when he cast Daniel into the lions' den;
but when, on receiving him safely out again, in his joy and
congratulations he cast in his enemies to be torn in pieces
and devoured by the same lions, what was he then,&mdash;a persecutor,
or not?<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> I call on you to answer me. For if he was,
why did not Daniel himself resist him, as he might so easily
have done in virtue of his great friendship for him, while yet
you bid us restrain kings from persecuting men? But if he
was not a persecutor, because he avenged with prompt justice
the outrage committed against a holy man, what kind of vengeance,
I would ask, must be exacted from kings for indignities
offered to the sacraments of Christ, if the limbs of the prophet
required such a vengeance because they were exposed to danger?
Again, I acknowledge that the king, as indeed is manifest,
was a persecutor when he cast the three children into the
furnace because they refused to worship his image; but I ask
whether he was still a persecutor when he set forth the decree
that all who should blaspheme against the one true God should
be destroyed, and their whole house laid waste? For if he
was a persecutor, why do you answer Amen to the words of
a persecutor?<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> But if he was not a persecutor, why do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
call those persecutors who deter you from the madness of blasphemy?
For if they compel you to worship an idol, then
they are like the impious king, and you are like the three
children; but if they are preventing you from fighting against
Christ, it is you who are impious if you attempt to do this.
But what they may be if they forbid this with terrible threats,
I do not presume to say. Do you find some other name for
them, if you will not call them pious emperors.</p>

<p>213. If I had been the person to bring forward these
examples of Daniel and the three children, you would perhaps
resist, and declare that they ought not to have been brought
from those times in illustration of our days; but God be
thanked that you yourself brought them forward, to prove
the point, it is true, which you desired to establish, but you
see that their force was rather in favour of what you least
would wish to prove. Perhaps you will say that this proceeds
from no deceit of yours, but from the fallibility of
human nature. Would that this were true! Amend it, then.
You will not lose in reputation; nay, it marks unquestionably
the higher mind to extinguish the fire of animosity by
a frank confession, than merely to escape the mist of falsehood
by acuteness of the understanding.</p>

should be converted from the error of heresy; but when the

cease to be heretics, how are we eagerly desiring communion

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xcvi.</span>&mdash;220. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "Choose, in short,
which of the two alternatives you prefer. If innocence is on

you call us guilty, why do you, who are yourselves innocent,
seek for our company?"</p>

<p>221. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: O most ingenious dilemma, or
rather most foolish verbosity! Is it not usual for the choice
of two alternatives to be offered to an antagonist, when it is
impossible that he should adopt both? For if you should
offer me the choice of the two propositions, that I should
say either that we were innocent, or that we were guilty; or,
again, of the other pair of propositions, viz. those concerning
you, I could not escape choosing either one or the other. But
as it is, you offer me the choice of these two, whether we
are innocent or you are guilty, and wish me to say which of
these two I choose for my reply. But I refuse to make a
choice; for I assert them both, that we are innocent, and that
you are guilty. I say that we are innocent of the false and
calumnious accusations which you bring against us, so far as
any of us, being in the Catholic Church, can say with a safe
conscience that we have neither given up the sacred books, nor
taken part in the worship of idols, nor murdered any man,
nor been guilty of any of the other crimes which you allege
against us; and that any who may have committed any such
offences, which, however, you have not proved in any case,
have thereby shut the doors of the kingdom of heaven, not
against us, but against themselves; "for every man shall
bear his own burden."<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> Here you have your answer on the
first head. And I further say that you are all guilty and
accursed,&mdash;not some of you owing to the sins of others, which
are wrought among you by certain of your number, and are
censured by certain others, but all of you by the sin of schism;
from which most heinous sacrilege no one of you can say that
he is free, so long as he refuses to hold communion with the
unity of all nations, unless, indeed, he be compelled to say
that Christ has told a lie concerning the Church which is
spread abroad among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a>
And so you have my second answer. See how I have made
you two replies, of which you were desirous that we should be
reduced to choose the one. At any rate, you should have
taken notice that both assertions might be made by us;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
and certainly, if this was what you wished, you should
have asked it as a favour of us that we should choose one
or the other, when you saw that it was in our power to
choose both.</p>

<p>222. But "if innocence is on your side, why do you persecute
us with the sword?" Look back for a moment on
your troops, which are not now armed after the ancient
fashion of their fathers only with cudgels, but have further
added to their equipment axes and lances and swords, and
determine for yourselves to which of us the question best belongs,
"Why do you persecute us with the sword?" "Or if
you call us guilty," say you, "why do you, who are yourselves
innocent, seek for our company?" Here I answer very briefly.
The reason why you, being guilty, are sought after by the
innocent, is that you may cease to be guilty, and begin to be
innocent. Here then I have chosen both of the alternatives
concerning us, and answered both of those concerning you:
only do you in turn choose one of the two. Are you innocent
or guilty? Here you cannot choose to make the two
assertions, and yet choose both, if so it pleases you. For at
any rate you cannot be innocent in reference to the same
circumstances in respect of which you are guilty. If therefore
you are innocent, do not be surprised that you are invited
to be at peace with your brethren; but if you are guilty, do
not be surprised that you are sought for punishment by kings.
But since of these two alternatives you assume one for yourselves,
and the other is alleged of you by us,&mdash;for you assume
to yourselves innocence, and it is alleged of you by us that
you are living impiously,&mdash;hear again once more what I
shall say on either head. If you are innocent, why do you
speak against the testimony of Christ? But if you are guilty,
why do you not fly for refuge to His mercy? For His testimony,
on the one hand, is to the unity of the world, and His
mercy, on the other, is in brotherly love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xcvii.</span>&mdash;223. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "Lastly, as we have
often said before, how great is your presumption, that you
should speak as you presume to do of kings, when David says,
'It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
man: it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence
in princes!'"<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a></p>

<p>224. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: We put no confidence in man,
but, so far as we can, we warn men to place their trust in the
Lord; nor do we put confidence in princes, but, so far as we
can, we warn princes to put confidence in the Lord. And
though we may seek aid from princes to promote the advantage
of the Church, yet do we not put confidence in them.
For neither did the apostle himself put confidence in that
tribune, in the sense in which the Psalmist talks of putting
confidence in princes, from whom he obtained for himself that
an escort of armed men should be assigned to him; nor did
he put confidence in the armed men, by whose protection he
escaped the snares of the wicked ones, in any such sense as
that of the Psalmist where he speaks of putting confidence in
men.<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> But neither do we find fault with you yourselves,
because you sought from the emperor that the basilicas should
be restored to you, as though you had put your trust in
Julian the prince; but we find fault with you, that you have
despaired of the witness of Christ, from whose unity you have
separated the basilicas themselves. For you received them at
the bidding of an enemy of Christ, that in them you should
despise the commands of Christ, whilst you find force and
truth in what Julian ordained, saying, "This, moreover, on the
petition of Rogatianus, Pontius, Cassianus, and other bishops,
not without an intermixture of clergy, is added to complete the
whole, that those proceedings which were taken to their prejudice
wrongly and without authority being all annulled,
everything should be restored to its former position;" and
yet you find nothing that has either force of truth in what
Christ ordained, saying, "Ye shall be witnesses unto me both
in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the
uttermost ends of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> We entreat you, let yourselves
be reformed. Return to this most manifest unity of the whole
world; and let all things be restored to their former position,
not in accordance with the words of the apostate Julian, but
in accordance with the words of our Saviour Christ. Have
pity on your own soul. We are not now comparing Constan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>tine
and Julian in order to show how different they are. We
are not saying, If you have not placed confidence in a man
and in a prince, when you said to a pagan and apostate emperor,
that "in him justice only found a place," seeing that
the party of Donatus has universally employed the prayers
and the proclamation in which those words occur, as is proved
by the records of the audience; much less ought we to be
accused by you, as though we put our confidence in any man
or prince, if without any blasphemous flattery we obtained
any request from Constantine or from the other Christian
emperors; or if they themselves, without our asking for it,
but remembering the account which they shall render to the
Lord, under whose words they tremble when they hear what
you yourself have quoted, "Be wise now therefore, O ye kings,"
etc., and many other sayings of the sort, make any ordinance
of their own accord in support of the unity of the Catholic
Church. But I say nothing about Constantine. It is Christ
and Julian that we contrast before you; nay, more than this,
it is God and man, the Son of God and the son of hell, the
Saviour of our souls and the destroyer of his own. Why do
you maintain the proclamation of Julian in the occupation of
the basilicas, and yet not maintain the gospel of Christ in
embracing the peace of the Church? We too cry out, Let all
things that have been done amiss be restored to their ancient
condition. The gospel of Christ is of greater antiquity than
the proclamation of Julian; the unity of Christ is of greater
antiquity than the party of Donatus; the prayers of the
Church to the Lord on behalf of the unity of the Church
are of greater antiquity than the prayers of Rogatianus, and
Pontius, and Cassianus, to Julian on behalf of the party of
Donatus. Are proceedings wrongly taken when kings forbid
division? and are they not wrongly taken when bishops
divide unity? Is that wrong action when kings minister to
the witness of Christ in defence of the Church? and is it not
wrong action when bishops contradict the witness of Christ in
order to deny the Church? We entreat you, therefore, that
the words of Julian himself, to whom you thus made supplication,
may be listened to, not in opposition to the gospel,
but in accordance with the gospel, and that all things which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
have been done amiss may be restored to their former condition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xcviii.</span>&mdash;225. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "On you, yes you,
you wretched men, I call, who, being dismayed with the fear
of persecution, whilst you seek to save your riches, not your
souls, love not so much the faithless faith of the traitors, as
the wickedness of the very men whose protection you have
won unto yourselves,&mdash;just in the same way as sailors, shipwrecked
in the waves, plunge into the waves by which they
must be overwhelmed, and in the great danger of their lives
seek unmistakeably the very object of their dread; just as the
madness of a tyrant, that he may be free from apprehension
of any person whatsoever, desires to be feared, though this is
fraught with peril to himself: so, so you fly for refuge to the
citadel of wickedness, being willing to look on the loss or
punishment of the innocent if you may escape fear for yourselves.
If you consider that you escape danger when you
plunge into ruin, truly also it is a faith that merits condemnation
to observe the faith of a robber. Lastly, it is trafficking
in a madman's gains to lose your own souls in order not to
lose your wealth. For the Lord Christ says, 'If a man shall
gain the whole world, and lose his own soul, what shall a
man give in exchange for his soul?'"<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a></p>

<p>226. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: That exhortation of yours
would be useful, I cannot but acknowledge, if any one were
to employ it in a good cause. It is undoubtedly well that
you have tried to deter men from preferring their riches to
their souls. But I would have you, who have heard these
words, listen also for a time to us; for we also say this, but
listen in what sense. If kings threaten to take away your
riches, because you are not Jews according to the flesh, or
because you do not worship idols or devils, or because you are
not carried about into any heresies, but abide in Catholic
unity, then choose rather that your riches should perish, that
you perish not yourselves; but be careful to prefer neither
anything else, nor the life of this world itself to eternal salvation,
which is in Christ. But if kings threaten you with loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
or condemnation, simply on the ground that you are heretics,
such things are terrifying you not in cruelty, but in mercy;
and your determination not to fear is a sign not of bravery,
but of obstinacy. Hear then the words of Peter, where he
says, "What glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults,
ye take it patiently?"<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> so that herein you have neither consolation
upon earth, nor in the world to come life everlasting;
but you have here the miseries of the unfortunate, and there
the hell of heretics. Do you see, therefore, my brother, with
whom I am now arguing, that you ought first to show whether
you hold the truth, and then to exhort men that in upholding
it they should be ready to give up all the blessings which
they possess in this present world? And so, when you do not
show this, because you cannot,&mdash;not that the talent is wanting,
but because the cause is bad,&mdash;why do you hasten by your
exhortations to make men both beggars and ignorant, both in
want and wandering from the truth, in rags and contentions,
household drudges and heretics, both losing their temporal
goods in this world, and finding eternal evils in the judgment
of Christ? But the cautious son, who, while he stands in
dread of his father's rod, keeps away from the lair of the
serpent, escapes both blows and destruction; whereas he
who despises the pains of discipline, when set in rivalry with
his own pernicious will, is both beaten and destroyed. Do
you not now understand, O learned man, that he who has
resigned all earthly goods in order to maintain the peace of
Christ, possesses God; whereas he who has lost even a very
few coins in behalf of the party of Donatus is devoid of
heart?</p>

riches of heaven. So again the same Lord says,
'Whosoever shall lose his substance, shall find it again an
hundredfold.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>

<p>228. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: It is not beside the purpose to
inquire into the true meaning of this passage also. For where
my purpose is not interfered with by any mistake which you
make, or any false impression which you convey in quoting
from the Scriptures, I do not concern myself about the matter.
It is not then written, "Whosoever shall lose his substance,"
but "Whosoever shall lose his life for my sake."<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> And the
passage about substance is not, "Whosoever shall lose," but
"Every one that hath forsaken;"<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> and that not only with
reference to substance of money, but many other things besides.
But you meanwhile have not lost your substance; but
whether you have forsaken it, in that you so boast of poverty,
I cannot say. And if by any chance my colleague Fortunatus
may know this, being in the same city with you, he never
told me, because I had never asked him. However, even if
you had done this, you have yet yourself quoted the testimony
of the apostle against yourself in this very epistle which you
have written: "Though I bestow all my goods to feed the
poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not
charity, it profiteth me nothing."<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> For if you had charity, you
would not bring charges against the whole world, which knows
nothing of you, and of which you know no more,&mdash;no, not
even such charges as are founded on the proved offences of the
Africans. If you had charity, you would not picture to yourself
a false unity in your calumnies, but you would learn to
recognise the unity that is most clearly set forth in the words
of the Lord: "Unto the uttermost part of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> But
if you did not do this, why do you boast as though you had
done it? Are you really so filled with fear of riches, that,
having nothing, you possess all things? Tell that to your
colleague Crispinus, who lately bought a farm near our city
of Hippo, that he might there plunge men into the lowest
abyss of error.<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> Whence I too know this all too well. You
perhaps are not aware of it, and therefore shout out in
security, "We stand in fear of riches." And hence I am
surprised that that cry of yours has been allowed to pass
Crispinus, so as to reach us. For between Constantina, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
you are, and Hippo, where I am, lies Calama, where he is,
nearer indeed to our side, but still between us. I wonder,
therefore, how it was that he did not first intercept this cry,
and strike it back so that it should not reach to our ears; and
that he did not, in opposition to you, recite in much more
copious phrase a eulogy on riches. For he not only stands
in no fear of riches, but he actually loves them. And certainly,
before you utter anything about the rest, you should
rehearse such views to him. If he makes no corrections, then
we have our answer ready. But for yourself, if it be true
that you are poor, you have with you my brother Fortunatus.
You will be more likely with such sentiments to please him,
who is my colleague, than Crispinus, who is your own.</p>

you speak of, not with a visible sword, but with that of which
it is said, "The sons of men, whose teeth are spears and
arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword."<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> For with this
sword of accusation and calumny against the world of which
you are wholly ignorant, you destroy the souls of those who
lack experience. But if you find fault with a most wicked
communion, as you term it, I would bid you presently, not
with my words, but with your own, to ascend, descend, enter,
turn yourself about, change sides, be such as was Optatus.
But if you return to your senses, and shall find that you are
not such as he, not because he refused to partake of the
sacraments with you, but because you took offence at what
he did, then you will acquit the world of crimes which do not
belong to it, and you will find yourself involved in the sin of
schism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ci.</span>&mdash;231. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "You therefore, who
prefer rather to be washed with the most false of baptisms
than to be regenerate, not only do not lay aside your sins, but
also load your souls with the offences of criminals. For as
the water of the guilty has been abandoned by the Holy
Spirit, so it is clearly filled full of the offences of the <i>traditors</i>.
To any wretched man, then, who is baptized by one of this
sort, we would say, If you have wished to be free from falsehood,
you are really drenched with falsity. If you desired
to shut out the sins of the flesh, you will, as the conscience
of the guilty comes upon you, be partakers likewise of their
guilt. If you wished to extinguish the flames of avarice, you
are drenched with deceit, you are drenched with wickedness,
you are drenched also with madness. Lastly, if you believe
that faith is identical in the giver and the receiver, you are
drenched with the blood of a brother by him who slays a
man. And so it comes to pass that you, who had come to
baptism free from sin, return from baptism guilty of the sin
of murder."</p>

<p>232. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: I should like to come to
argument with those who shouted assent when they either
heard or read those words of yours. For such men have not
ears in their heart, but their heart in their ears. Yet let
them read again and again, and consider, and find out for
themselves, not what the sound of those words is, but what
they mean. First of all, to sift the meaning of the last
clause, "So it comes to pass," you say, "that you who had come
to baptism free from sin, return from baptism guilty of the sin
of murder:" tell me, to begin with, who there is that comes
to baptism free from sin, with the single exception of Him
who came to be baptized, not that His iniquity should be
purged away, but that an example of humility might be given
us? For what shall be forgiven to one free from sin? Or
are you indeed endowed with such an eloquence, that you can
show to us some innocence which yet committeth sin? Do
you not hear the words of Scripture saying, "No one is clean
from sin in Thy sight, not even the infant whose life is but of
a single day upon the earth?"<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> For whence else is it that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
one hastens even with infants to seek remission of their sins?
Do you not hear the words of another Scripture, "In sin did
my mother conceive me?"<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> In the next place, if a man returns
a murderer, who had come without the guilt of murder,
merely because he receives baptism at a murderer's hands, then
all they who returned from receiving baptism at the hands of
Optatus were made partakers with Optatus. Go now, and
see with what face you cast in our teeth that we excite the
wrath of kings against you. Are you not afraid that as many
satellites of Gildo will be sought for among you, as there are
men who may have been baptized by Optatus? Do you see
at length how that sentence of yours, like an empty bladder,
has rattled not only with a meaningless sound, but on your
own head?</p>

<p>233. To go on to the other earlier arguments which you
have set before us to be refuted, they are of such a nature
that we must needs allow that every one returns from baptism
endued with the character of him by whom he is baptized;
but God forbid that those whom you baptize should return
from you infected with the same madness as possesses you
when you make such a statement! And what a dainty sound
there was in your words, "You are drenched with deceit, you
are drenched with wickedness, you are drenched also with
madness!" Surely you would never pour forth words like this
unless you were, not drenched, but filled even to repletion
with madness. Is it then true, to say nothing of the rest,
that all who come untainted with covetousness to receive
baptism at the hands of your covetous colleagues, or the priests
of your party, return guilty of covetousness, and that those
who run in soberness to the whirlpool of intoxication to be
baptized return in drunkenness? If you entertain and teach
such views as this, you will have the effrontery even to quote,
as making against us, the passage which you advanced some
little time ago: "It is better to trust in the Lord than to put
any confidence in man. It is better to trust in the Lord than
to put any confidence in princes."<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> What is the meaning of
your teaching, I would ask, save only this, that we should put
our confidence, not in the Lord, but in man, when you say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
the baptized person is made to resemble him who has baptized
him? And since you assume this as the fundamental principle
of your baptism, are men to place their trust in you?
and are those to place their trust in princes who were disposed
to place it in the Lord? Truly I would bid them hearken
not to you, but rather to those proofs which you have urged
against ourselves, ay, and to words more awful yet; for not
only is it written, "It is better to trust in the Lord than to
put confidence in man," but also, "Cursed be the man that
trusteth in man."<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. cii.</span>&mdash;234. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "Imitate indeed the prophets,
who feared to have their holy souls deceived with false
baptism. For Jeremiah says of old that among impious men
water is as one that lies. 'Water,' he says, 'that lies has not
faith.'"</p>

<p>235. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: Any one that hears these words,
without being acquainted with the Scriptures, and who does
not believe that you are either so far astray as not to know
what you are saying, or deceiving in such wise that he whom
you have deceived should not know what he says, would believe
that the prophet Jeremiah, wishing to be baptized, had
taken precautions not to be baptized by impious men, and had
used these words with this intent. For what was your object
in saying, previous to your quotation of this passage, "Imitate
indeed the prophets, who feared to have their holy souls
deceived with false baptism?" Just as though, in the days of
Jeremiah, any one were washed with the sacrament of baptism,
except so far as the Pharisees almost every moment bathed
themselves, and their couches and cups and platters, with the
washings which the Lord condemned, as we read in the gospel.<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a>
How then could Jeremiah have said this, as though he desired
to be baptized, and sought to avoid being baptized by impious
men? He said it, then, when he was complaining of a faithless
people, by the corruption of whose morals he was vexed,
not wishing to associate with their deeds; and yet he did not
separate himself bodily from their congregation, nor seek other
sacraments than those which the people received as suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
to that time, according to the law of Moses. To this people,
therefore, in their evil mode of life, he gave the name of "a
wound," with which the heart of the righteous man was
grievously smitten, whether speaking thus of himself, or foreshadowing
in himself what he foresaw would come to pass.
For he speaks as follows: "O Lord, remember me, and visit
me; make clear my innocence before those who persecute me
in no spirit of long-suffering: know that for Thy sake I have
suffered rebuke from those that scorn Thy words. Make their
portion complete; and Thy word shall be unto me the joy
and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by Thy name, O
Lord God of hosts. I sat not in the assembly of the mockers,
but was afraid of the presence of Thy hand; I sat alone, because
I was filled with bitterness. Why do those who make
me sad prevail against me? My wound is grievous; whence
shall I be healed? It is become unto me as lying water, that
has no faith."<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> In all this it is manifest what the prophet
wished to be understood, but manifest only to those who do
not wish to distort to their own perverse cause the meaning of
what they read. For Jeremiah says that his wound has become
unto him as lying water, which cannot inspire faith;
but he wished that by his wound those should be understood
who made him sad by the evil conduct of their lives. Whence
also the apostle says, "Without were fightings, within were
fears;"<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> and again, "Who is weak, and I am not weak? who
is offended, and I burn not?"<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> And because he had no hopes
that they could be reformed, therefore he said, "Whence shall
I be healed?" as though his own pain must needs continue
so long as those among whom he was compelled to live continued
what they were. But that a people is commonly understood
under the appellation of water is shown in the Apocalypse,
where we understand "many waters" to mean "many
peoples," not by any conjecture of our own, but by an express
explanation in the place itself.<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> Abstain then from blaspheming
the sacrament of baptism from any misunderstanding,
or rather error, even when found in a man of most abandoned
character; for not even in the lying Simon was the baptism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
which he received a lying water,<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> nor do all the liars of your
party administer a lying water when they baptize in the name
of the Trinity. For neither do they begin to be liars only
when they are betrayed and convicted, and so forced to acknowledge
their misdeeds; but rather they were already liars, when,
being adulterers and accursed, they pretended to be chaste and
innocent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ciii.</span>&mdash;236. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "David also said, 'The
oil of the sinner shall not anoint my head.' Who is it, therefore,
that he calls a sinner? Is it I who suffer your violence,
or you who persecute the innocent?"</p>

<p>237. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: As representing the body of
Christ, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and
mainstay of the truth, dispersed throughout the world, on
account of the gospel which was preached, according to the
words of the apostle, "to every creature which is under
heaven:"<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> as representing the whole world, of which David,
whose words you cannot understand, has said, "The world also
is stablished, that it cannot be moved;"<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> whereas you contend
that it not only has been moved, but has been utterly destroyed:
as representing this, I answer, I do not persecute the
innocent. But David said, "The oil of the sinner," not of the
<i>traditor</i>; not of him who offers incense, not of the persecutor,
but "of the sinner." What then will you make of your interpretation?
See first whether you are not yourself a sinner.
It is nothing to the point if you should say, I am not a <i>traditor</i>,
I am not an offerer of incense, I am not a persecutor.
I myself, by the grace of God, am none of these, nor is the
world, which cannot be moved. But say, if you dare, I am
not a sinner. For David says, "The oil of the sinner." For
so long as any sin, however light, be found in you, what
ground have you for maintaining that you are not concerned
in the expression that is used, "The oil of the sinner?" For I
would ask whether you use the Lord's prayer in your devotions?
For if you do not use that prayer, which our Lord
taught His disciples for their use, where have you learned
another, proportioned to your merits, as exceeding the merits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
the apostles? But if you pray, as our great Master deigned
to teach us, how do you say, "Forgive us our trespasses, as
we forgive them that trespass against us?" For in this petition
we are not referring to those sins which have already
been forgiven us in baptism. Therefore these words in the
prayer either exclude you from being a petitioner to God, or
else they make it manifest that you too are a sinner. Let
those then come and kiss your head who have been baptized
by you, whose heads have perished through your oil. But see
to yourself, both what you are and what you think about
yourself. Is it really true that Optatus, whom pagans, Jews,
Christians, men of our party, men of your party, all proclaim
throughout the whole of Africa to have been a thief, a traitor,
an oppressor, a contriver of schism; not a friend, not a client,
but a tool of him<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> whom one of your party declared to have
been his count, companion, and god,&mdash;is it true that he was not
a sinner in any conceivable interpretation of the term? What
then will they do whose heads were anointed by one guilty of
a capital offence? Do not those very men kiss your heads,
on whose heads you pass so serious a judgment by this interpretation
which you place upon the passage? Truly I would
bid you bring them forth, and admonish them to heal themselves.
Or is it rather your heads which should be healed,
who run so grievously astray? What then, you will ask, did
David really say? Why do you ask me? rather ask himself.
He answers you in the verse above: "The righteous shall
smite me in kindness, and shall reprove me; but let not the
oil of the sinner anoint my head."<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> What could be plainer?
what more manifest? I had rather, he says, be healed by a
rebuke administered in kindness, than be deceived and led
astray by smooth flattery, coming on me as an ointment on
my head. The self-same sentiment is found elsewhere in
Scripture under other words: "Better are the wounds of a
friend than the proffered kisses of an enemy."<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. civ.</span>&mdash;238. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "But he thus praises
the ointment of concord among brethren: 'Behold how good
and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down
upon the beard, even Aaron's beard; that went down to the
skirts of his garments; as the dew of Hermon, and as the
dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there
the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.'<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a>
Thus, he says, is unity anointed, even as the priests are
anointed."</p>

<p>239. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: What you say is true. For
that priesthood in the body of Christ had an anointing, and
its salvation is secured by the bond of unity. For indeed
Christ Himself derives His name from chrism, that is, from
anointing. Him the Hebrews call the Messiah, which word
is closely akin to the Ph&oelig;nician language, as is the case with
very many other Hebrew words, if not with almost all.<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a>
What then is meant by the head in that priesthood, what
by the beard, what by the skirts of the garments? So far
as the Lord enables me to understand, the head is none other
than the Saviour of the body, of whom the apostle says,
"And He is the head of the body, the Church."<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> By the
beard is not unsuitably understood fortitude. Therefore, on
those who show themselves to be brave in His Church, and
cling to the light of His countenance, to preach the truth
without fear, there descends from Christ Himself, as from the
head, a sacred ointment, that is to say, the sanctification of
the Spirit. By the skirts of the garments we are here given
to understand that which is at the top of the garments,
whereby the head of Him who gives the clothing passes on
its way. By this are signified those who are perfected in
faith within the Church. For in the skirts is perfection.
And I presume you must remember what was said to a certain
rich man: "If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven;
and come and follow me."<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> He indeed went away sorrowful,
slighting what was perfect, choosing what was imperfect. But
does it follow that there were wanting those who were so
made perfect by such a surrender of earthly things, that the
ointment of unity descended upon them, as from the head
upon the skirts of the garments? For, putting aside the
apostles, and those who were immediately associated with
those leaders and teachers of the Church, whom we understand
to be represented with greater dignity and more conspicuous
fortitude in the beard, read in the Acts of the
Apostles, and see those who "brought the prices of the things
that were sold, and laid them at the apostles' feet. Neither
said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed
was his own; but they had all things common: and distribution
was made unto every man according as he had need.
And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart
and of one soul."<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> I doubt not that you are aware that it
is so written. Recognise, therefore, how good and how pleasant
it is for brethren to dwell together in unity. Recognise
the beard of Aaron; recognise the skirts of the spiritual garments.
Search the Scriptures themselves, and see where those
things began to be done; you will find that it was in Jerusalem.
From this skirt of the garment is woven together the
whole fabric of unity throughout all nations. By this the
Head entered into the garment, that Christ should be clothed
with all the variety of the several nations of the earth, because
in this skirt of the garment appeared the actual variety
of tongues. Why, therefore, is the Head itself, whence that
ointment of unity descended, that is, the spiritual fragrance
of brotherly love,&mdash;why, I say, is the Head itself exposed
to your resistance, while it testifies and declares that "repentance
and remission of sins should be preached in His
name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem?"<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> And by
this ointment you wish the sacrament of chrism to be understood,
which is indeed holy as among the class of visible
signs, like baptism itself, but yet can exist even among the
worst of men, wasting their life in the works of the flesh, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
never destined to possess the kingdom of heaven, and having
therefore nothing to do either with the beard of Aaron, or
with the skirts of his garments, or with any fabric of priestly
clothing. For where do you intend to place what the apostle
enumerates as "the manifest works of the flesh, which," he
says, "are these; fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry,
poisonings, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife,
seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings,
and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also
told you in time past, that they which do such things shall
not inherit the kingdom of God?"<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> I put aside fornications,
which are committed in secret; interpret uncleanness
as you please, I am willing to put it aside as well. Let us
put on one side also poisons, since no one is openly a compounder
or giver of poisons. I put aside also heresies, since
you will have it so. I am in doubt whether I ought to put
aside idolatry, since the apostle classes with it covetousness,
which is openly rife among you. However, setting aside all
these, are there none among you lascivious, none covetous,
none open in their indulgence of enmities, none fond of strife,
or fond of emulation, wrathful, given to seditions, envious,
drunken, wasting their time in revellings? Are none of such
a character anointed among you? Do none die well known
among you to be given to such things, or openly indulging
in them? If you say there are none, I would have you consider
whether you do not come under the description yourself,
since you are manifestly telling lies in the desire for strife.
But if you are yourself severed from men of this sort, not by
bodily separation, but by dissimilarity of life, and if you behold
with lamentation crowds like these around your altars,
what shall we say, since they are anointed with holy oil, and
yet, as the apostle assures us with the clearness of truth, shall
not inherit the kingdom of God? Must we do such impious
despite to the beard of Aaron and to the skirts of his garments,
as to suppose that they are to be placed there? Far
be that from us. Separate therefore the visible holy sacrament,
which can exist both in the good and in the bad,&mdash;in
the former for their reward, in the latter for judgment; sepa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>rate
it from the invisible unction of charity, which is the
peculiar property of the good. Separate them, separate them,
ay, and may God separate you from the party of Donatus,
and call you back again into the Catholic Church, whence you
were torn by them while yet a catechumen, to be bound by
them in the bond of a deadly distinction. Now are ye not
in the mountains of Zion, the dew of Hermon on the mountains
of Zion, in whatever sense that be received by you; for
you are not in the city upon a hill, which has this as its sure
sign, that it cannot be hid. It is known therefore unto all
nations. But the party of Donatus is unknown to the majority
of nations, therefore is it not the true city.</p>

in bonds; that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak."<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a>
See how prayer is made for an apostle, which you would have
not made for a bishop. Do you perceive of how devilish a
nature your pride is? Prayer is made for an apostle, that he
may make manifest the mystery of Christ as he ought to speak.
Accordingly, if you had a pious people under you, you ought
to have exhorted them to pray for you, that you might not
give utterance as you ought not. Are you more righteous than
the evangelist John, who says, "If we say that we have no
sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us?"<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> Finally,
are you more righteous than Daniel, whom you yourself quoted
in this very epistle, going so far as to say, "The most righteous
king cast forth Daniel, as he supposed, to be devoured by
wild beasts?"&mdash;a thing which he never did suppose, since he
said to Daniel himself, in the most friendly spirit, as the context
of the lesson shows, "Thy God, whom thou servest continually,
He will deliver thee."<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> But on this subject we have
already said much. With regard to the question now before us,
viz. that Daniel was most righteous, it is proved not by your
testimony, though that might be sufficient for me in the argument
which I hold with you, but by the testimony of the Spirit
of God, speaking also by the mouth of Ezekiel, where he named
three men of most eminent righteousness, Noah, Daniel, and
Job, who, he said, were the only men that could be saved from
a certain excessive wrath of God, which was hanging over all
the rest.<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> A man, therefore, of the highest righteousness, one
of three conspicuous for righteousness, prays, and says, "Whiles
I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin, and the
sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before
the Lord my God."<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> And you say that you are without sin,
because forsooth you are a priest; and if the people sin, you
pray for them: but if you sin, who shall pray for you? For
clearly by the impiety of such arrogance you show yourself
to be unworthy of the mediation of that Priest whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
prophet would have to be understood in these words, which
you do not understand. For now that no one may ask why
this was said, I will explain it, so far as by God's grace I
shall be able. God was preparing the minds of men, by His
prophet, to desire a Priest of such a sort that none should
pray for Him. He was Himself prefigured in the times of the
first people and the first temple, in which all things were figures
for our ensample. Therefore the high priest used to enter
alone into the holy of holies, that he might make supplication
for the people, which did not enter with the priest into that
inner sanctuary;<a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> just as our High Priest is entered into the
secret places of the heavens, into that truer holy of holies,
whilst we for whom He prays are still placed here.<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> It is
with this reference that the prophet says, "If the people shall
sin, the priest shall pray for them: but if the priest shall sin,
who will pray for him?" Seek therefore a priest of such a
kind that he cannot sin, nor need that one should pray for
him. And for this reason prayer is made for the apostles by
the people;<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> but for that Priest who is the Master and Lord
of the apostles is prayer not made. Hear John confessing
this, and saying, "My little children, these things write I unto
you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an Advocate
with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, and He is the
propitiation for our sins."<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> "<i>We</i> have," he says; and "for
<i>our</i> sins." I pray you, learn humility, that you may not fall,
or rather, that in time you may arise again. For had you not
already fallen, you never would have used such words.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. cvi.</span>&mdash;242. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "And that none who
is a layman may claim to be free from sin, they are all bound
by this prohibition: 'Be not partakers of other men's sins.'"</p>

<p>243. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: You are mistaken <i>toto c&oelig;lo</i>, as
the saying is, by reason of your pride, whilst, by reason of your
humility, you are unwilling to communicate with the whole
world. For, in the first place, this was not spoken to a layman;
and, in the second place, you are wholly ignorant in what
sense it was spoken. The apostle, writing to Timothy, gives
this warning to none other than Timothy himself, to whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
says in another place, "Neglect not the gift that is in thee,
which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the
hands of the presbytery."<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> And by many other proofs it is
made clear that he was not a layman. But in that he says,
"Be not partaker of other men's sins,"<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> he means, Be not partaker
voluntarily, or with consent. And hence he immediately
subjoins directions how he shall obey the injunction, saying,
"Keep thyself pure." For neither was Paul himself partaker
of other men's sins, because he endured false brethren, over
whom he groans, in bodily unity; nor did the apostles who
preceded him partake of the thievery and crime of Judas,
because they partook of the holy supper with him when he
had already sold his Lord, and been pointed out as the traitor
by that Lord.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. cvii.</span>&mdash;244. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "By this sentence, again,
the apostle places in the same category those who have fellowship
in the consciousness of evil. 'Worthy of death,' he says,
'are both those who do such things, and those who have
pleasure in them that do them.'"<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a></p>

<p>245. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: I care not in what manner you
have used these words, they are true. And this is the substance
of the teaching of the Catholic Church, that there is a
great difference between those who consent because they take
pleasure in such things, and those who tolerate while they
dislike them. The former make themselves chaff, while they
follow the barrenness of the chaff; the latter are the grain.
Let them wait for Christ, who bears the winnowing-fan, that
they may be separated from the chaff.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. cviii.</span>&mdash;246. <span class="smcap">Petilianus</span> said: "Come therefore to
the Church, all ye people, and flee the company of <i>traditors</i>,
if you would not also perish with them. For that you may
the more readily know that, while they are themselves guilty,
they yet entertain an excellent opinion of our faith, let me
inform you that I baptize their polluted ones; they, though
may God never grant them such an opportunity, receive those
who are made mine by baptism,&mdash;which certainly they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
not do if they recognised any defects in our baptism. See
therefore how holy that is which we give, when even our sacrilegious
enemy fears to destroy it."</p>

<p>247. <span class="smcap">Augustine</span> answered: Against this error I have said
much already, both in this work and elsewhere. But since
you think that in this sentence you have so strong a confirmation
of your vain opinions, that you deemed it right to end
your epistle with these words, that they might remain as it
were the fresher in the minds of your readers, I think it well
to make a short reply. We recognise in heretics that baptism,
which belongs not to the heretics but to Christ, in such sort
as in fornicators, in unclean persons or effeminate, in idolaters,
in poisoners, in those who are fond of contention, in the envious,
in drunkards, in revellers; and in men like these we hold valid
the baptism which is not theirs but Christ's. For of men like
these, and among them are included heretics also, none, as the
apostle says, shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> Nor are
they to be considered as being in the body of Christ, which is
the Church, simply because they are materially partakers of
the sacraments. For the sacraments indeed are holy, even in
such men as these, and shall be of force in them to greater
condemnation, because they handle and partake of them unworthily.
But the men themselves are not within the constitution
of the Church, which grows in its members through
connection and contact with Christ, to the exaltation of God.
For that Church is founded on a rock, as the Lord says,
"Upon this rock I will build my Church."<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> But they build
on the sand, as the same Lord says, "Every one that heareth
these sayings, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a
foolish man, which built his house upon the sand."<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> But that
you may not suppose that the Church which is upon a rock
is in one part only of the earth, and does not extend even to
its furthest boundaries, hear her voice groaning from the psalm,
amid the evils of her pilgrimage. For she says, "From the
end of the earth will I cry unto Thee, when my heart is overwhelmed:
lead me to the Rock that is higher than I. For
Thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the
enemy."<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a>
See how she cries from the end of the earth. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
is not therefore in Africa alone, nor only among the Africans,
who send a bishop from Africa to Rome to a few Montenses,<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a>
and into Spain to the house of one lady.<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> See how she is
exalted on a rock. All, therefore, are not to be deemed to be
in her which build upon the sand, that is, which hear the
words of Christ and do them not, even though both among us
and among you they have and transmit the sacrament of baptism.
See how her hope is in God the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost,&mdash;not in Peter or in Paul, still less in Donatus
or Petilianus. What we fear, therefore, to destroy, is not
yours, but Christ's; and it is holy of itself, even in sacrilegious
hands. For we cannot receive those who come from
you, unless we destroy in them whatsoever appertains to you.
For we destroy the treachery of the deserter, not the stamp
of the sovereign. Accordingly, do you yourself consider and
annul what you said: "I," say you, "baptize their polluted
ones; they, though may God never grant them such an opportunity,
receive those who are made mine by baptism." For
you do not baptize men who are infected, but you rebaptize
them, so as to infect them. But we do not receive men who
are made yours by baptism; but we destroy that error of yours
whereby they are made yours, and we receive the baptism of
Christ, by which they are baptized. Therefore it is not without
significance that you introduce the words, "Though may God
never grant them such an opportunity." For you said, "They,
though may God never grant them such an opportunity, receive
those who are made mine by baptism." And in this, while you
intend the meaning to be, "May God never give them the opportunity
of receiving such as are mine," I suppose that, without
knowing what it meant, you said, "May God never make
them mine that you should receive them." For we pray that
those may not be really yours who come over at the present
moment to the Catholic Church. Nor do they come over so as to
be ours by right of baptism, but by fellowship with us, and that
with us they may belong to Christ, in virtue of their baptism.</p>

WROTE TO HIM AFTER HAVING SEEN THE FIRST OF AUGUSTINE'S EARLIER

AUGUSTINE RATHER SHOWS THAT THE ARGUMENTS of PETILIANUS HAD
BEEN DEFICIENT AND IRRELEVANT, THAN BRINGS FORWARD ARGUMENTS
IN SUPPORT OF HIS OWN STATEMENTS.</small></p></blockquote>


<p class="cap">CHAP. I.&mdash;1. Being able to read, Petilianus, I have read
your letter, in which you have shown with sufficient
clearness that, in supporting the party of Donatus against the
Catholic Church, you have neither been able to say anything
to the purpose, nor been allowed to hold your tongue. What
violent emotions did you endure, what a storm of feelings
surged within your heart, on reading the answer which I made,
with all possible brevity and clearness, to that portion of your
letter which alone at that time had come into my hands!
For you saw that the truth which we maintain and defend
was confirmed with such strength of argument, and illustrated
with such abundant light, that you could not find anything
which could be said against it, whereby the charges which we
make might be refuted. You observed, also, that the attention
of many who had read it was fixed on you, since they
desired to know what you would say, what you would do,
how you would escape from the difficulty, how you would
make your way out of the strait in which the word of God
had encompassed you. Hereupon you, when you ought to
have shown contempt for the opinion of the foolish ones, and
to have gone on to adopt sound and truthful sentiments, preferred
rather to do what Scripture has foretold of men like
you: "Thou hast loved evil more than good, and lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
rather than to speak righteousness."<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> Just as if I in turn
were willing to recompense unto you railing for railing; in
which case, what should we be but two evil speakers, so that
those who read our words would either preserve their self-respect
by throwing us aside with abhorrence, or eagerly devour
what we wrote to gratify their malice? For my own
part, since I answer every one, whether in writing or by word
of mouth, even when I have been attacked with insulting
accusations, in such language as the Lord puts in my mouth,
restraining and crushing the stings of empty indignation in
the interests of my hearer or reader, I do not strive to prove
myself superior to my adversary by abusing him, but rather
to be a source of health in him by convicting him of his
error.</p>

<p>2. For if those who take into consideration what you have
written have any feelings whatsoever, how did it serve you
in the cause which is at issue between us respecting the
Catholic communion and the party of Donatus, that, leaving a
matter which was in a certain sense of public interest, you
should have been led by private animosity to attack the life
of an individual with malicious revilings, just as though that
individual were the question in debate? Did you think so
badly, I do not say of Christians, but of the whole human
race, as not to suppose that your writings might come into
the hands of some prudent men, who would lay aside all
thoughts of individuals like us, and inquire rather into the
question which was at issue between us, and pay heed, not
to who and what we were, but to what we might be able to
advance in defence of the truth or against error? You should
have paid respect to these men's judgment, you should have
guarded yourself against their censure, lest they should think
that you could find nothing to say, unless you set before
yourself some one whom you might abuse by any means within
your power. But one may see by the thoughtlessness and
foolishness of some men, who listen eagerly to the quarrels of
any learned disputants, that while they take notice of the
eloquence wherewith you lavish your abuse, they do not perceive
with what truth you are refuted. At the same time, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
think your object partly was that I might be driven, by the
necessity of defending myself, to desert the very cause which
I had undertaken; and that so, while men's attention was
turned to the words of opponents who were engaged not in
disputation, but in quarrelling, the truth might be obscured,
which you are so afraid should come to light and be well
known among men. What therefore was I to do in opposing
such a design as this, except to keep strictly to my subject,
neglecting rather my own defence, praying withal that no
personal calumny may lead me to withdraw from it? I will
exalt the house of my God, whose honour I have loved, with
the tribute of a faithful servant's voice, but myself I will
humiliate and hold of no account. "I had rather be a door-keeper
in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of
unrighteousness."<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> I will therefore turn my discourse from
you, Petilianus, for a time, and direct it rather to those whom
you have endeavoured to turn away from me by your revilings,
as though my endeavour rather were that men should
be converted unto me, and not rather with me unto God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ii.</span>&mdash;3. Hear therefore, all ye who have read his
revilings, what Petilianus has vented against me with more
anger than consideration. To begin with, I will address you
in the words of the apostle, which certainly are true, whatever
I myself may be: "Let a man so account of us as of
the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.
Moreover, it is required of stewards, that a man be found
faithful. But with me it is a very small matter that I should
be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not
mine own self." With regard to what immediately follows,
although I do not venture to apply to myself the words, "For
I am conscious of nothing in myself,"<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> yet I say confidently
in the sight of God, that I am conscious in myself of none of
those charges which Petilianus has brought against my life
since the time when I was baptized in Christ; "yet am I
not hereby justified: but He that judgeth me is the Lord.
Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come,
who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then
shall every man have praise of God. And these things,
brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself; that ye
might learn in us not to think of men above that which is
written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against
another."<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> "Therefore let no man glory in men: for all
things are yours; and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's."<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a>
Again I say, "Let no man glory in men;" nay, oftentimes I
repeat it, "Let no man glory in men." If you perceive anything
in us which is deserving of praise, refer it all to His
praise, from whom is every good gift and every perfect gift;
for it is "from above, and cometh down from the Father of
lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a>
For what have we which we did not receive? and if
we have received it, let us not boast as though we had not
received it.<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> And in all these things which you know to be
good in us, be ye our followers, at any rate, if we are Christ's;<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a>
but if, on the other hand, you either suspect, or believe, or
see that any evil is in us, hold fast to that saying of the
Lord's, in which you may safely resolve not to desert His
Church because of men's ill deeds: Whatsoever we bid you
observe, that observe and do; but whatsoever evil works
you think or know to be in us, those do ye not.<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> For this is
not the time for me to justify myself before you, when I have
undertaken, neglecting all considerations of self, to recommend
to you what is for your salvation, that no one should make
his boast of men. For "cursed be the man that trusteth in
man."<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> So long as this precept of the Lord and His apostle
be adhered to and observed, the cause which I serve will be
victorious, even if I myself, as my enemy would fain have
thought, am faint and oppressed in my own cause. For if
you cling most firmly to what I urge on you with all my
might, that every one is cursed who places his trust in man,
so that none should make his boast of man, then you will
in no wise desert the threshing-floor of the Lord on account
of the chaff which either is now being dispersed beneath the
blast of the wind of pride, or will be separated by the final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
winnowing;<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> nor will you fly from the great house on account
of the vessels made to dishonour;<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> nor will you quit the net
through the breaches made in it because of the bad fish which
are to be separated on the shore;<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> nor will you leave the
good pastures of unity, because of the goats which are to be
placed on the left when the Good Shepherd shall divide the
flock;<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> nor will you separate yourselves by an impious secession,
because of the mixture of the tares, from the society of
that good wheat, whose source is that grain that dies and is
multiplied thereby, and that grows together throughout the
world until the harvest. For the field is the world,&mdash;not only
Africa; and the harvest is the end of the world,<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a>&mdash;not the era
of Donatus.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. iii.</span>&mdash;4. These comparisons of the gospel you doubtless
recognise. Nor can we suppose them given for any other purpose,
except that no one should make his boast in man, and
that no one should be puffed up for one against another, or
divided one against another, saying, "I am of Paul," when
certainly Paul was not crucified for you, nor were you baptized
in the name of Paul, much less in that of C√¶cilianus,
or of any one of us,<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> that you may learn, that so long as
the chaff is being bruised with the corn, so long as the bad
fishes swim together with the good in the nets of the Lord,
till the time of separation shall come, it is your duty rather
to endure the admixture of the bad out of consideration for
the good, than to violate the principle of brotherly love
towards the good from any consideration of the bad. For
this admixture is not for eternity, but for time alone; nor is
it spiritual, but corporal. And in this the angels will not be
liable to err, when they shall collect the bad from the midst of
the good, and commit them to the burning fiery furnace. For
the Lord knoweth those which are His. And if a man cannot
depart bodily from those who practise iniquity so long as
time shall last, at any rate, let every one that nameth the
name of Christ depart from iniquity itself.<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> For in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
meantime he may separate himself from the wicked in life,
and in morals, and in heart and affections, and in the same
respects depart from his society; and separation such as this
should always be maintained. But let the separation in the
body be waited for till the end of time, faithfully, patiently,
bravely. In consideration of which expectation it is said,
"Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall
strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, upon the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> For
the greatest palm of toleration is won by those who, among
false brethren that have crept in unawares, seeking their own,
and not the things of Jesus Christ, yet show that they on
their part seek not to disturb the love which is not their own,
but Jesus Christ's, by any turbulent or rash dissension, nor
to break the unity of the Lord's net, in which are gathered
together fish of every kind, till it is drawn to the shore, that
is, till the end of time, by any wicked strife fostered in the
spirit of pride: whilst each might think himself to be something,
being really nothing, and so might lead himself astray,
and wish that sufficient reason might be found for the separation
of Christian peoples in the judgment of himself or of
his friends, who declare that they know beyond all question
certain wicked men unworthy of communion in the sacraments
of the Christian religion: though whatever it may be
that they know of them, they cannot persuade the universal
Church, which, as it was foretold, is spread abroad throughout
all nations, to give credit to their tale. And when they refuse
communion with these men, as men whose character they
know, they desert the unity of the Church; whereas they
ought rather, if there really were in them that charity which
endureth all things, themselves to bear what they know in
one nation, lest they should separate themselves from the
good whom they were unable throughout all nations to fill
with the teaching of evil alien to them. Whence even, without
discussing the case, in which they are convicted by the
weightiest proofs of having uttered calumnies against the
innocent, they are believed with greater probability to have
invented false charges of giving up the sacred books, when
they are found to have themselves committed the far more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
heinous crime of wicked division in the Church. For even,
if whatever imputations they have cast of giving up the
sacred books were true, yet they in no wise ought to have
abandoned the society of Christians, who are commended by
holy Scripture even to the ends of the world, on considerations
which they have been familiar with, while these men
showed that they were not acquainted with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. iv.</span>&mdash;5. Nor would I therefore be understood to urge
that ecclesiastical discipline should be set at naught, and that
every one should be allowed to do exactly as he pleased, without
any check, without a kind of healing chastisement, a
lenity which should inspire fear, the severity of love. For
then what will become of the precept of the apostle, "Warn
them that are unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the
weak, be patient toward all men; see that none render evil
for evil unto any man?"<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> At any rate, when he added these
last words, "See that none render evil for evil unto any man,"
he showed with sufficient clearness that there is no rendering
of evil for evil when one chastises those that are unruly, even
though for the fault of unruliness be administered the punishment
of chastising. The punishment of chastising therefore
is not an evil, though the fault be an evil. For indeed it is
the steel, not of an enemy inflicting a wound, but of a surgeon
performing an operation. Things like this are done within
the Church, and that spirit of gentleness within its pale burns
with zeal towards God, lest the chaste virgin which is espoused
to one husband, even Christ, should in any of her members
be corrupted from the simplicity which is in Christ, as Eve
was beguiled by the subtilty of the serpent.<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> Notwithstanding,
far be it from the servants of the father of the family
that they should be unmindful of the precept of their Lord,
and be so inflamed with the fire of holy indignation against
the multitude of the tares, that while they seek to gather
them in bundles before the time, the wheat should be rooted
up together with them. And of this sin these men would be
held to be guilty, even though they showed that those were
true charges which they brought against the <i>traditors</i> whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
they accused; because they separated themselves in a spirit
of impious presumption, not only from the wicked, whose
society they professed to be avoiding, but also from the good
and faithful in all nations of the world, to whom they could
not prove the truth of what they said they knew; and with
themselves they drew away into the same destruction many
others over whom they had some slight authority, and who
were not wise enough to understand that the unity of the
Church dispersed throughout the world was on no account to
be forsaken for other men's sins. So that, even though they
themselves knew that they were pressing true charges against
certain of their neighbours, yet in this way a weak brother,
for whom Christ died, was perishing through their knowledge;<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a>
whilst, being offended at other men's sins, he was destroying
in himself the blessing of peace which he had with the good
brethren, who partly had never heard such charges, partly
had shrunk from giving hasty credence to what was neither
discussed nor proved, partly, in the peaceful spirit of humility,
had left these charges, whatsoever they might be, to the
cognizance of the judges of the Church, to whom the whole
matter had been referred, across the sea.</p>

of sin and error such as this. With however great light of
learning and of reputation he may shine, however much he
may boast himself to be a precious stone, who endeavours to
lead you after him, remember always that that brave woman
who alone is lovely only to her husband, whom holy Scripture
portrays to us in the last chapter of the Book of Proverbs,
is more precious than any precious stones. Let no one say, I
will follow such an one, for it was even he that made me a
Christian; or, I will follow such an one, for it was even he

concerning His Church, or any other matter whatsoever which
is connected with your faith and life, to say nothing of ourselves,
who are by no means to be compared with him who
said, "Though we," at any rate, as he went on to say,
"Though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto
you than that which" ye have received in the lawful and
evangelical Scriptures, "let him be accursed."<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> While carrying
out this principle of action in our dealings with you, and
with all whom we desire to gain in Christ, and, amongst other
things, while preaching the holy Church which we read of as
promised in the epistles of God, and see to be fulfilled according
to the promises in all nations of the world, we have
earned, not the rendering of thanks, but the flames of hatred,
from those whom we desire to have attracted into His most
peaceful bosom; as though we had bound them fast in that
party for which they cannot find any defence that they should
make; or as though we so long before had given injunctions
to prophets and apostles that they should insert in their books
no proofs by which it might be shown that the party of
Donatus was the Church of Christ. And we indeed, dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
brethren, when we hear false charges brought against us by
those whom we have offended by preaching the eloquence of
truth, and confuting the vanity of error, have, as you know,
the most abundant consolation. For if, in the matters which
they lay to my charge, the testimony of my conscience does
not stand against me in the sight of God, where no mortal
eye can reach, not only ought I not to be cast down, but I
should even rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is my
reward in heaven.<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> For in fact I ought to consider, not how
bitter, but how false is what I hear, and how true He is in
defence of whose name I am exposed to it, and to whom it
is said, "Thy name is as ointment poured forth."<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> And
deservedly does it smell sweet in all nations, though those
who speak evil of us endeavour to confine its fragrance within
one corner of Africa. Why therefore should we take amiss
that we are reviled by men who thus detract from the glory
of Christ, whose party and schism find offence in what was
foretold so long before of His ascent into the heavens, and of
the pouring forth of His name, as of the savour of ointment:
"Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let Thy glory
be above all the earth?"<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. vii.</span>&mdash;8. Whilst we bear the testimony of God to
this and the like effect against the vain speaking of men, we
are forced to undergo bitter insults from the enemies of the
glory of Christ. Let them say what they will, whilst He
exhorts us, saying, "Blessed are they which are persecuted
for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you,
and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my
sake." What He says in the first instance, "for righteousness'
sake," He has repeated in the words that He uses afterwards,
"for my sake;" seeing that He "is made unto us
wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory
in the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> And when He says, "Rejoice, and be exceeding
glad, for great is your reward in heaven,"<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> if I hold in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
good conscience what is said "for righteousness' sake," and
"for my sake," whosoever wilfully detracts from my reputation
is against his will contributing to my reward. For
neither did He only instruct me by His word, without also
confirming me by His example. Follow the faith of the
holy Scriptures, and you will find that Christ rose from the
dead, ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of the
Father. Follow the charges brought by His enemies, and
you will presently believe that He was stolen from the
sepulchre by His disciples. Why then should we, while
defending His house to the best of the abilities given us by
God, expect to meet with any other treatment from His
enemies? "If they have called the Master of the house
Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of His household?"<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a>
If, therefore, we suffer, we shall also reign with
Him. But if it be not only the wrath of the accuser that
strikes the ear, but also the truth of the accusation that stings
the conscience, what does it profit me if the whole world were
to exalt me with perpetual praise? So neither the eulogy of
him who praises has power to heal a guilty conscience, nor
does the insult of him who reviles wound the good conscience.
Nor, however, is your hope which is in the Lord deceived, even
though we chance to be in secret what our enemies wish us
to be thought; for you have not placed your hope in us, nor
have you ever heard from us any doctrine of the kind. You
therefore are safe, whatever we may be, who have learned to
say, "I have trusted in the Lord; therefore I shall not slide;"<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a>

you astray to the earthly heights of proud men, you know
how to answer, "In the Lord put I my trust: how say ye to

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. viii.</span>&mdash;9. Nor is it only you that are safe, whatever
we may be, because you are satisfied with the very truth of
Christ which is in us, in so far as it is preached through us,
and everywhere throughout the world, and because, listening
to it willingly, so far as it is set forth by the humble ministry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
of our tongue, you also think well and kindly of us,&mdash;for so
your hope is in Him whom we preach to you out of His loving-kindness,
which extends over you,&mdash;but further, all of you,
who also received the sacrament of holy baptism from our
ministering, may well rejoice in the same security, seeing that
you were baptized, not into us, but into Christ. You did not
therefore put on us, but Christ; nor did I ask you whether
you were converted unto me, but unto the living God; nor
whether you believed in me, but in the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost. But if you answered my question with
truthful hearts, you were placed in a state of salvation, not by
the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but by the answer
of a good conscience towards God;<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> not by a fellow-servant,
but by the Lord; not by the herald, but by the judge. For it
is not true, as Petilianus inconsiderately said, that "the conscience
of the giver," or, as he added, "the conscience of him
who gives in holiness, is what we look for to wash the conscience
of the recipient." For when something is given that is of
God, it is given in holiness, even by a conscience which is not
holy. And certainly it is beyond the power of the recipient
to discern whether the said conscience is holy or not holy;
but that which is given he can discern with clearness. That
which is known to Him who is ever holy is received with perfect
safety, whatever be the character of the minister at whose
hands it is received. For unless the words which are spoken
from Moses' seat were necessarily holy, He that is the Truth
would never have said, "Whatsoever they bid you observe,
that observe and do." But if the men who uttered holy words
were themselves holy, He would not have said, "Do not ye
after their works: for they say, and do not."<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> For it is true
that in no way do men gather grapes of thorns, because grapes
never spring from the root of a thorn; but when the shoot of
the vine has entwined itself in a thorn hedge, the fruit which
hangs upon it is not therefore looked upon with dread, but the
thorn is avoided, while the grape is plucked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ix.</span>&mdash;10. Therefore, as I have often said before, and
am desirous to bring home to you, whatsoever we may be, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
are safe, who have God for your Father and His Church for
your mother. For although the goats may feed in company
with the sheep, yet they shall not stand on the right hand;
although the chaff may be bruised together with the wheat, it
shall not be gathered into the barn; although the bad fish
may swim in company with the good within the Lord's nets,
they shall not be gathered into vessels. Let no man make
his boast even in a good man: let no man shun the good gifts
of God even in a bad man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. x.</span>&mdash;11. Let these things suffice you, my beloved Christian
brethren of the Catholic Church, so far as the present
business is concerned; and if you hold fast to this in Catholic
affection, so long as you are one sure flock of the one Shepherd,
I am not too much concerned with the abuse that any enemy
may lavish on me, your partner in the flock, or, at any rate,
your watch-dog, so long as he compels me to bark rather in your
defence than in my own. And yet, if it were necessary for the
cause that I should enter on my own defence, I should do so
with the greatest brevity and the greatest ease, joining freely
with all men in condemning and bearing witness against the
whole period of my life before I received the baptism of Christ,
so far as relates to my evil passions and my errors, lest, in
defending that period, I should seem to be seeking my own
glory, not His, who by His grace delivered me even from
myself. Wherefore, when I hear that life of mine abused, in
whatever spirit he may be acting who abuses it, I am not so
thankless as to be grieved. However much he finds fault with
any vice of mine, I praise him in the same degree as my
physician. Why then should I disturb myself about defending
those past and obsolete evils in my life, in respect of which,
though Petilianus has said much that is false, he has yet left
more that is true unsaid? But concerning that period of my
life which is subsequent to my baptism, to you who know me
I speak unnecessarily in telling of those things which might
be known to all mankind; but those who know me not ought
not to act with such unfairness towards me as to believe
Petilianus rather than you concerning me. For if one should
not give credence to the panegyrics of a friend, neither should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
one believe the detraction of an enemy. There remain, therefore,
those things which are hidden in a man, in which conscience
alone can bear testimony, which cannot be a witness
before men. Herein Petilianus says that I am a Manich√¶an,
speaking of the conscience of another man; I, speaking of my
own conscience, aver that I am not. Choose which of us you
had sooner believe. Notwithstanding, since there is not any
need even of this short and easy defence on my part, where
the question at issue is not concerning the merits of any individual,
whoever he may be, but concerning the truth<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> of the
whole Church, I have more also to say to any of you, who,
being of the party of Donatus, have read the evil words which
Petilianus has written about me, which I should not have
heard from him if I had had no care about the loss of your
salvation; but then I should have been wanting in the bowels
of Christian love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xi.</span>&mdash;12. What wonder is it then, if, when I draw in
the grain that has been shaken forth from the threshing-floor
of the Lord, together with the soil and chaff, I suffer injury from
the dust that rebounds against me; or that, when I am diligently
seeking after the lost sheep of my Lord, I am torn by
the briars of thorny tongues? I entreat you, lay aside for a
time all considerations of party feeling, and judge with some
degree of fairness between Petilianus and myself. I am desirous
that you should be acquainted with the cause of the
Church; he, that you should be familiar with mine. For what
other reason than because he dares not bid you disbelieve my
witnesses, whom I am constantly citing in the cause of the
Church,&mdash;for they are prophets and apostles, and Christ Himself,
the Lord of prophets and apostles,&mdash;whereas you easily
give him credit in whatever he may choose to say concerning
me, a man against a man, and one, moreover, of your own
party against a stranger to you? Petilianus therefore reigns
supreme. Whenever he aims any abuse at me, of whatever
character it may be, you all applaud and shout assent. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
cause he has found wherein the victory is possible for him,
but only with you for judges. He will seek for neither proof
nor witness; for all that he has to prove in his words is this,
that he lavishes most copious abuse on one whom you most
cordially hate. For whereas, when the testimony of divine
Scripture is quoted in such abundance and in such express
terms in favour of the Catholic Church, he remains silent
amidst your grief, he has chosen for himself a subject on
which he may speak amidst applause from you; and though
really conquered, yet, pretending that he stands unmoved, he
may make statements concerning me like this, and even worse
than this. It is enough for me,<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> in respect of the cause which
I am now pleading, that whatsoever I may be found to be, yet
the Church for which I speak is unconquered.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xii.</span>&mdash;13. For I am a man of the threshing-floor of
Christ: if a bad man, then part of the chaff; if good, then of
the grain. The winnowing-fan of this threshing-floor is not the
tongue of Petilianus; and hereby, whatever evil he may have
uttered, even with truth, against the chaff of this threshing-floor,
this in no way prejudices its grain. But whereinsoever
he has cast any revilings or calumnies against the grain itself,
its faith is tried on earth, and its reward increased in the
heavens. For where men are holy servants of the Lord, and
are fighting with holiness for God, not against Petilianus, or
any flesh and blood like him, but against principalities and
powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this world,<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> such as
are all enemies of the truth, to whom I would that we could
say, "Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in
the Lord,"<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a>&mdash;where the servants of God, I say, are waging
such a war as this, then all the calumnious revilings that are
uttered by their enemies, which cause an evil report among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
the malicious and those that are rash in believing, are weapons
on the left hand: it is with such as these that even the
devil is defeated. For when we are tried by good report,
whether we resist the exaltation of ourselves to pride, and are
tried by evil report, whether we love even those very enemies
by whom it is invented against us, then we overcome the devil
by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the
left. For when the apostle had used the expression, "By
the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the
left," he at once goes on to say, as if in explanation of the
terms, "By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good
report,"<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> and so forth,&mdash;reckoning honour and good report
among the armour on the right hand, dishonour and evil
report among that upon the left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xiii.</span>&mdash;14. If, therefore, I am a servant of the Lord,
and a soldier that is not reprobate, with whatever eloquence
Petilianus stands forth reviling me, ought I in any way to be
annoyed that he has been appointed for me as a most accomplished
craftsman of the armour on the left? It is necessary
that I should fight in this armour as skilfully as possible in
defence of my Lord, and should smite with it the enemy
against whom I wage an unseen fight, who in all cunning
strives and endeavours, with the most perverse and ancient
craftiness, that this should lead me to hate Petilianus, and so
be unable to fulfil the command which Christ has given, that
we should "love our enemies."<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> But from this may I be
saved by the mercy of Him who loved me, and gave Himself
for me, so that, as He hung upon the cross, He said,
"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do;"<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a>
and so taught me to say of Petilianus, and all other enemies
of mine like him, "Father, forgive them; for they know not
what they do."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xiv.</span>&mdash;15. Furthermore, if I have obtained from you,
in accordance with my earnest endeavours, that, laying aside
from your minds all prejudice of party, you should be impartial
judges between Petilianus and myself, I will show to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
you that he has not replied to what I wrote, that you may
understand that he has been compelled by lack of truth to
abandon the dispute, and also see what revilings he has
allowed himself to utter against the man who so conducted
it that he had no reply to make. And yet what I am going
to say displays itself with such manifest clearness, that,
even though your minds were estranged from me by party
prejudice and personal hatred, yet, if you would only read
what is written on both sides, you could not but confess
among yourselves, in your inmost hearts, that I have spoken
truth.</p>

<p>16. For, in replying to the former part of his writings,
which then alone had come into my hands, without taking
any notice of his wordy and sacrilegious revilings, where he
says, "Let those men cast in our teeth our twice-repeated
baptism, who, under the name of baptism, have polluted their
souls with a guilty washing; whom I hold to be so obscene
that no manner of filth is less clean than they; whose lot it
has been, by a perversion of cleanliness, to be defiled by the
water wherein they washed;" I thought that what follows
was worthy of discussion and refutation, where he says, "For
what we look for is the conscience of the giver, that the conscience
of the recipient may thereby be cleansed;" and I
asked what means were to be found for cleansing one who
receives baptism when the conscience of the giver is polluted,
without the knowledge of him who is to receive the sacrament
at his hands.<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xv.</span>&mdash;17. Read now the most profuse revilings which
he has poured forth whilst puffed up with indignation against
me, and see whether he has given me any answer, when I ask
what means are to be found for cleansing one who receives
baptism when the conscience of the giver is polluted, without
the knowledge of him who receives the sacrament at his
hands. I beg of you to search minutely, to examine every
page, to reckon every line, to ponder every word, to sift the
meaning of each syllable, and tell me, if you can discover it,
where he has made answer to the question, What means are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
to be found for cleansing the conscience of the recipient who
is unaware that the conscience of the giver is polluted?</p>

<p>18. For how did it bear upon the point that he added a
phrase which he said was suppressed by me, maintaining that
he had written in the following terms: "The conscience of
him who gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse
the conscience of the recipient?" For to prove to you that it
was not suppressed by me, its addition in no way hinders my
inquiry, or makes up the deficiency which was found in him.
For in the face of those very words I ask again, and I beg of
you to see whether he has given any answer, If "the conscience
of him who gives in holiness is what we look for to
cleanse the conscience of the recipient," what means are to be
found for cleansing the conscience of the recipient when the
conscience of the giver is stained with guilt, without the
knowledge of him who is to receive the sacrament at his
hands? I insist upon an answer being given to this. Do not
allow that any one should be prejudiced by revilings irrelevant
to the matter in hand. If the conscience of him who gives in
holiness is what we look for,&mdash;observe that I do not say "the
conscience of him who gives," but that I added the words,
"of him who gives in <i>holiness</i>,"&mdash;if the conscience, then, of
him who gives in holiness is what we look for, what means
are to be found for cleansing one who receives baptism when
the conscience of the giver is polluted, without the knowledge
of him who is to receive the sacrament at his hands?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xvi.</span>&mdash;19. Let him go now, and with panting lungs
and swollen throat find fault with me as a mere dialectician.
Nay, let him summon, not me, but the science of dialectics
itself, to the bar of popular opinion as a forger of lies, and
let him open his mouth to its widest against it, with all the
noisiest uproar of a special pleader. Let him say whatever
he pleases before the inexperienced, that so the learned may
be moved to wrath, while the ignorant are deceived. Let him
call me, in virtue of my rhetoric, by the name of the orator
Tertullus, by whom Paul was accused;<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> and let him give himself
the name of Advocate,<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> in virtue of the pleading in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
he boasts his former power, and for this reason delude himself
with the notion that he is, or rather was, a namesake of
the Holy Ghost. Let him, with all my heart, exaggerate the
foulness of the Manich√¶ans, and endeavour to divert it on to
me by his barking. Let him quote all the exploits of those
who have been condemned, whether known or unknown to
me; and let him turn into the calumnious imputation of a
prejudged crime, by some new right entirely his own, the fact
that a former friend of mine there named me in my absence
to the better securing of his own defence. Let him read the
titles that have been placed upon my letters by himself or by
his friends, as suited their pleasure, and boast that he has, as
it were, involved me hopelessly in their expressions. When I
acknowledge certain eulogies of bread, uttered in all simplicity
and merriment, let him take away my character with the
absurd imputations of poisonous baseness and madness. And
let him entertain so bad an opinion of your understanding, as
to imagine that he can be believed when he declares that
pernicious love-charms were given to a woman, not only with
the knowledge, but actually with the complicity<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> of her husband.
What the man who was afterwards to ordain me
bishop<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> wrote about me in anger, while I was as yet a priest,
he may freely seek to use as evidence against me. That the
same man sought and obtained forgiveness from a holy Council
for the wrong he thus had done me, he is equally at liberty
to ignore as being in my favour,&mdash;being either so ignorant or
so forgetful of Christian gentleness, and the commandment of
the gospel, that he brings as an accusation against a brother
what is wholly unknown to that brother himself, as he humbly
entreats that pardon may in kindness be extended to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xvii.</span>&mdash;20. Let him further go on, in his discourse of
many but manifestly empty words, to matters of which he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
wholly ignorant, or in which rather he abuses the ignorance
of the mass of those who hear him, and from the confession of a
certain woman, that she had called herself a catechumen of the
Manich√¶ans, being already a full member of the Catholic Church,
let him say or write what he pleases concerning their baptism,&mdash;not
knowing, or pretending not to know, that the name of
catechumen is not bestowed among them upon persons to
denote that they are at some future time to be baptized, but
that this name is given to such as are also called Hearers, on
the supposition that they cannot observe what are considered
the higher and greater commandments, which are observed by
those whom they think right to distinguish and honour by the
name of Elect. Let him also maintain with wonderful rashness,
either as himself deceived or as seeking to deceive, that
I was a priest among the Manich√¶ans. Let him set forth
and refute, in whatever sense seems good to him, the words
of the third book of my <i>Confessions</i>, which, both in themselves,
and from much that I have said before and since, are perfectly
clear to all who read them. Lastly, let him triumph in my
stealing his words, because I have suppressed two of them, as
though the victory were his upon their restoration.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xviii.</span>&mdash;21. Certainly in all these things, as you can
learn or refresh your memory by reading his letter, he has
given free scope to the impulse of his tongue, with all the
licence of boasting which he chose to use, but nowhere has he
told us where means are to be found for cleansing the conscience
of the recipient, when that of the giver has been
stained with sin without his knowing it. But amid all his
noise, and after all his noise, serious as it is, too terrible as he
himself supposes it to be, I deliberately, as it is said, and to
the purpose,<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> ask this question once again: If the conscience
of him who gives in holiness is what we look for, what means
are to be found for cleansing one who receives baptism without
knowing that the conscience of the giver is stained with
sin? And throughout his whole epistle I find nothing said
in answer to this question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xix.</span>&mdash;22. For perhaps some one of you will say to me,
All these things which he said against you he wished to have
force for this purpose, that he might take away your character,
and through you the character of those with whom you hold
communion, that neither they themselves, nor those whom you
endeavour to bring over to your communion, may hold you to
be of any further importance. But, in deciding whether he
has given no answer to the words of your epistle, we must
look at them in the light of the passage in which he proposed
them for consideration. Let us then do so: let us look at
his writings in the light of that very passage. Passing over,
therefore, the passage in which I sought to introduce my
subject to the reader, and to ignore those few prefatory words
of his, which were rather insulting than relevant to the subject
under discussion, I go on to say, "He says, 'What we
look for is the conscience of the giver, to cleanse that of the
recipient.' But supposing the conscience of the giver is concealed
from view, and perhaps defiled with sin, how will it
be able to cleanse the conscience of the recipient, if, as he
says, 'what we look for is the conscience of the giver, to
cleanse that of the recipient?' For if he should say that it
makes no matter to the recipient what amount of evil may
be concealed from view in the conscience of the giver, perhaps
that ignorance may have such a degree of efficacy as this, that
a man cannot be defiled by the guilt of the conscience of him
from whom he receives baptism, so long as he is unaware of
it. Let it then be granted that the guilty conscience of his
neighbour cannot defile a man so long as he is unaware of it;
but is it therefore clear that it can further cleanse him from
his own guilt? Whence then is a man to be cleansed who
receives baptism, when the conscience of the giver is polluted
without the knowledge of him who is to receive it, especially
when he goes on to say, 'For he who receives faith from the
faithless receives not faith but guilt?'"<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xx.</span>&mdash;23. All these statements in my letter Petilianus
set before himself for refutation. Let us see, therefore, whether
he has refuted them; whether he has made any answer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
them at all. For I add the words which he calumniously
accuses me of having suppressed, and, having done so, I ask
him again the same question in an even shorter form; for
by adding these two words he has helped me much in shortening
this proposition. If the conscience of him who gives in
holiness is what we look for to cleanse that of the recipient,
and if he who has received his faith wittingly from one that
is faithless, receives not faith but guilt, where shall we find
means to cleanse the conscience of the recipient, when he has
not known that the conscience of the giver is stained with
guilt, and when he receives his faith unwittingly from one that
is faithless? I ask, where shall we find means to cleanse it?
Let him tell us; let him not pass off into another subject;
let him not cast a mist over the eyes of the inexperienced.
To end with, at any rate, after many tortuous circumlocutions
have been interposed and thoroughly worked out, let him at
last tell us where we shall find means to cleanse the conscience
of the recipient when the stains of guilt in the conscience of
the faithless baptizer are concealed from view, if the conscience
of him who gives in holiness is what we look for to
cleanse that of the recipient, and if he who has received his
faith wittingly from one that is faithless, receives not faith
but guilt? For the man in question receives it from a faithless
man, who has not the conscience of one who gives in
holiness, but a conscience stained with guilt, and veiled from
view. Where then shall we find means to cleanse his conscience?
whence then does he receive his faith? For if he is
neither then cleansed, nor then receives faith, when the faithlessness
and guilt of the baptizer are concealed, why, when
these are afterwards brought to light and condemned, is he
not then baptized afresh, that he may be cleansed and receive
faith? But if, while the faithlessness and guilt of the other
are concealed, he is cleansed and does receive faith, whence
does he obtain his cleansing, whence does he receive faith,
when there is not the conscience of one that gives in holiness
to cleanse the conscience of the recipient? Let him tell us
this; let him make reply to this: Whence does he obtain his
cleansing, whence does he receive faith, if the conscience of
him that gives in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
conscience of the recipient, seeing that this does not exist,
when the baptizer conceals his character of faithlessness and
guilt? To this no answer has been made whatever.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxi.</span>&mdash;24. But see, when he is reduced to straits
in the argument, he again makes an attack on me full of mist
and wind, that the calm clearness of the truth may be obscured;
and through the extremity of his want he becomes full of resources,
shown not in saying what is true, but in unbought
empty revilings. Hold fast, with the keenest attention and
utmost perseverance, what he ought to answer,&mdash;that is, where
means may be found for cleansing the conscience of the recipient
when the stains in that of the giver are concealed,&mdash;lest
possibly the blast of his eloquence should wrest this from your
hands, and you in turn should be carried away by the dark
tempest of his turgid discourse, so as wholly to fail in seeing
whence he has digressed, and to what point he should return;
and see where the man can wander, whilst he cannot stand
in the matter which he has undertaken. For see how much
he says, through having nothing that he ought to say. He
says "that I slide in slippery places, but am held up; that
I neither destroy nor confirm the objections that I make; that
I devise uncertain things in the place of certainty; that I do
not permit my readers to believe what is true, but cause them
to look with increased suspicion on what is doubtful." He
says "that I have the accursed talents of the Academic philosopher
Carneades."<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> He endeavours to insinuate what the
Academics think of the falseness or the falsehood of human
sensation, showing in this also that he is wholly without
knowledge of what he says. He declares that "it is said by
them that snow is black, whereas it is white; and that silver
is black; and that a tower is round, or free from projections,
when it is really angular; that an oar is broken in the water,
while it is whole." And all this because, when he had said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
that "the conscience of him that gives," or "of him that gives
in holiness, is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of
the recipient," I said in reply, What if the conscience of the
giver be hidden from sight, and possibly be stained with guilt?
Here you have his black snow, and black silver, and his tower
round instead of angular, and the oar in the water broken
while yet whole, in that I suggested a state of the case which
might be conceived, and could not really exist, that the conscience
of the giver might be hidden from view, and possibly
might be stained with guilt!</p>

<p>25. Then he continues in the same strain, and cries out:
"What is that <i>what if?</i> what is that <i>possibly?</i> except the
uncertain and wavering hesitation of one who doubts, of whom
your poet says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'What if I now return to those who say, What if the sky should fall?'"<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Does he mean that when I said, What if the conscience of
the giver be hidden from sight, and possibly be stained with
guilt? that it is much the same as if I had said, What if the
sky should fall? There certainly is the phrase What if,
because it is possible that it may be hidden from view, and it
is possible that it may not. For when it is not known what
the giver is thinking of, or what crime he has committed, then
his conscience is certainly hidden from the view of the recipient;
but when his sin is plainly manifest, then it is not
hidden. I used the expression, And possibly may be stained
with guilt, because it is possible that it may be hidden from
view and yet be pure; and again, it is possible that it may
be hidden from view and be stained with guilt. This is the
meaning of the What if; this the meaning of the Possibly.
Is this at all like "What if the sky should fall?" O how
often have men been convicted, how often have they confessed
themselves that they had consciences stained with guilt
and adultery, whilst men were unwittingly baptized by them
after they were degraded by the sin subsequently brought to
light, and yet the sky did not fall! What have we here
to do with Pilus and Furius,<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> who defended the cause of in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>justice
against justice? What have we here to do with the
atheist Diagoras,<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> who denied that there was any God, so that
he would seem to be the man of whom the prophet spoke
beforehand, "The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God?"<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a>
What have we here to do with these? Why were their names
brought in, except that they might make a diversion in favour
of a man who had nothing to say? that while he is at any
rate saying something, though needlessly, about these, the
matter in hand may seem to be progressing, and an answer
may be supposed to be made to a question which remains
without an answer?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxii.</span>&mdash;26. Lastly, if these two or three words, What
if, and Possibly, are so absolutely intolerable, that on their
account we should have aroused from their long sleep the
Academics, and Carneades, and Pilus, and Furius, and Diagoras,
and black snow, and the falling of the sky, and everything
else that is equally senseless and absurd, let them be
removed from our argument. For, as a matter of fact, it is by
no means impossible to express what we desire to say without
them. There is quite sufficient for our purpose in what is
found a little later, and has been introduced by himself from
my letter: "By what means then is he to be cleansed who
receives baptism when the conscience of the giver is polluted,
and that without the knowledge of him who is to receive the
sacrament?"<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> Do you acknowledge that here there is no
What if, no Possibly? Well then, let an answer be given.
Give close heed, lest he be found to answer this in what follows.
"But," says he, "I bind you in your cavilling to the
faith of believing, that you may not wander further from it.
Why do you turn away your life from errors by arguments of
folly? Why do you disturb the system of belief in respect
of matters without reason? By this one word I bind and
convince you." It was Petilianus that said this, not I. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
words are from the letter of Petilianus; but from that letter,
to which I just now added the two words which he accuses
me of having suppressed, showing that, notwithstanding their
addition, the pertinency of my question, to which he makes
no answer, remains with greater brevity and simplicity. It
is beyond dispute that these two words are, In holiness, and
Wittingly: so that it should not be, "The conscience of him
who gives," but "The conscience of him who gives <i>in holiness</i>;"
and that it should not be, "He who has received his
faith from one that is faithless," but "He who has <i>wittingly</i>
received his faith from one that is faithless." And yet I had
not really suppressed these words; but I had not found them
in the copy which was placed in my hands. It is possible
enough that it was incorrect; nor indeed is it wholly beyond
the possibility of belief that even by this suggestion Academic
fury should be roused against me, and that it should be asserted
that, in declaring the copy to be incorrect, I had said much the
same sort of thing as if I had declared that snow was black.
For why should I repay in kind his rash suggestion, and say
that, though he pretends that I suppressed the words, he really
added them afterwards himself, since the copy, which is not
angry, can confirm that mark of incorrectness, without any
abusive rashness on my part?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxiii.</span>&mdash;27. And, in the first place, with regard to
that first expression, "Of him who gives in holiness," it does
not interfere in the least with my inquiry, by which he is so
much distressed, whether I use the expression, "If the conscience
of him that gives is what we look for," or the fuller
phrase, "If the conscience of him that gives in holiness is
what we look for, to cleanse the conscience of the recipient,"
by what means then is he to be cleansed who receives baptism
if the conscience of the giver is polluted, without the
knowledge of him who is to receive the sacrament? And with
regard to the other word that is added, "wittingly," so that the
sentence should not run, "He who has received his faith from
one that is faithless," but "He who has wittingly received
his faith from one that is faithless, receives not faith but
guilt," I confess that I had said some things as though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
word were absent, but I can easily afford to do without them;
for they caused more hindrance to the facility of my argument
than they gave assistance to its possibility. For how much
more readily, how much more plainly and shortly, can I put
the question thus: "If the conscience of him who gives
in holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of
the recipient," and "if he who has wittingly received his
faith from one that is faithless receives not faith but guilt,"
by what means is he cleansed, from whom the stain on the
conscience of him who gives, but not in holiness, is hidden?
and whence does he receive true faith, who is baptized unwittingly
by one that is faithless? Let it be declared whence
this shall be, and then the whole theory of baptism will be
disclosed; then all that is matter of investigation will be
brought to light,&mdash;but only if it be declared, not if the time
be consumed in evil-speaking.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxiv.</span>&mdash;28. Whatever, therefore, he finds in these two
words,&mdash;whether he brings calumnious accusations about their
suppression, or boasts of their being added,&mdash;you perceive that
it in no way hinders my question, to which he can find no
answer that he can make; and therefore, not wishing to remain
silent, he takes the opportunity of making an attack upon my
character,&mdash;retiring, I should have said, from the discussion, except
that he had never entered on it. For just as though the
question were about me, and not about the truth of the Church,
or of baptism, therefore he says that I, by suppressing these
two words, have argued as though it were no stumblingblock
in the way of my conscience that I have ignored what he
calls the sacrilegious conscience of him who polluted me. But
if this were so, the addition of the word "wittingly," which is
thus introduced, would be in my favour, and its suppression
would tell against me. For if I had wished that my defence
should be urged on the ground that I should be supposed to
have been unacquainted with the conscience of the man that
baptized me, then I would accept Petilianus as having spoken
in my behalf, since he does not say in general terms, "He that
has received his faith from one that is faithless," but "He
that has wittingly received his faith from one that is faithless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
receives not faith but guilt;" so that hence I might boast
that I had received not guilt, but faith, since I could say I
did not receive it wittingly from one that was faithless, but
was unacquainted with the conscience of him that gave it.
See, therefore, and reckon carefully, if you can, what an amount
of superfluous words he wastes on the one phrase, "I was
unacquainted with," which he declares that I have used;
whereas I never used it at all,&mdash;partly because the question
under discussion was not concerning me, so that I should need
to use it; partly because no fault was apparent in him that
baptized me, so that I should be forced to say in my defence
that I had been unacquainted with his conscience.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxv.</span>&mdash;29. And yet Petilianus, to avoid answering
what I have said, sets before himself what I have not, and
draws men's attention away from the consideration of his debt,
lest they should exact the answer which he ought to make.
He constantly introduces the expressions, "I have been unacquainted
with," "I say," and makes answer, "But if you were
unacquainted with;" and, as though convicting me, so that it
should be out of my power to say, "I was unacquainted with,"
he quotes Mensurius, C√¶cilianus, Macarius, Taurinus, Romanus,
and declares that "they had acted in opposition to the Church
of God, as I could not fail to know, seeing that I am an
African, and already well advanced in years:" whereas, so
far as I hear, Mensurius died in the unity of the communion
of the Church, before the faction of Donatus separated itself
therefrom; whilst I had read the history of C√¶cilianus, that
they themselves had referred his case to Constantine, and that
he had been once and again acquitted by the judges whom
that emperor had appointed to try the matter, and again a
third time by the sovereign himself, when they appealed to
him. But whatever Macarius and Taurinus and Romanus
did, either in their judicial or executive functions, in behalf of
unity as against their pertinacious madness, it is beyond doubt
that it was all done in accordance with the laws, which these
same persons made it unavoidable should be passed and put
in force, by referring the case of C√¶cilianus to the judgment
of the emperor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span></p>

<p>30. Among many other things which are wholly irrelevant,
he says that "I was so hard hit by the decision of the proconsul
Messianus, that I was forced to fly from Africa." And
in consequence of this falsehood (to which, if he was not the
author of it, he certainly lent malicious ears when others
maliciously invented it), how many other falsehoods had he
the hardihood not only to utter, but actually to write with
wondrous rashness, seeing that I went to Milan before the
consulship of Banto, and that, in pursuance of the profession
of rhetorician which I then followed, I recited a panegyric in
his honour as consul on the first of January, in the presence
of a vast assembly of men; and after that journey I only returned
to Africa after the death of the tyrant Maximus:
whereas the proconsul Messianus heard the case of the Manich√¶ans
after the consulship of Banto, as the day of the
chronicles inserted by Petilianus himself sufficiently shows.
And if it were necessary to prove this for the satisfaction of
those who are in doubt, or believe the contrary, I could produce
many men, illustrious in their generation, as most sufficient
witnesses to all that period of my life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxvi.</span>&mdash;31. But why do we make inquiry into these
points? Why do we both suffer and cause unnecessary delay?
Are we likely to find out by such a course as this what means
we are to use for cleansing the conscience of the recipient, who
does not know that the conscience of the giver is stained with
guilt? whence the man is to receive faith who is unwittingly
baptized by one that is faithless?&mdash;the question which Petilianus
had proposed to himself to answer in my epistle, then
going on to say anything else he pleased except what the
matter in hand required. How often has he said, "If ignorant
you were,"&mdash;as though I had said, what I never did say, that
I was unacquainted with the conscience of him who baptized
me. And he seemed to have no other object in all that his
evil-speaking mouth poured forth, except that he should appear
to prove that I had not been ignorant of the misdeeds of those
among whom I was baptized, and with whom I was associated
in communion, understanding fully, it would seem, that ignorance
did not convict me of guilt. See then that if I were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
ignorant, as he has repeated so often, beyond all doubt I should
be innocent of all these crimes. Whence then should I
receive faith, seeing that I was baptized unwittingly by one
that was faithless? For he has not repeated "If ignorant you
were" so often without purpose, but simply to prevent my
being reputed innocent, esteeming beyond all doubt that no
man's innocence is violated if he unwittingly receives his faith
from one that is faithless, and is not acquainted with the stains
on the conscience of him that gives, but not in holiness. Let
him say, therefore, by what means such men are to be cleansed,
whence they are to receive not guilt but faith. But let him
not deceive you. Let him speak; let him not, while uttering
much, say nothing; or rather, let him not say much while
saying nothing. Next, to urge a point which occurs to me,
and must not be passed over,&mdash;if I am guilty because I have
not been ignorant, to use his own phraseology, and I am
proved not to have been ignorant, because I am an African,
and already advanced in years, let him grant that the youths
of other nations throughout the world are not guilty, who had
no opportunity either from their race, or from that age you
bring against me, of knowing the points that are laid to our
charge, be they true, or be they false; and yet they, if they
have fallen into your hands, are rebaptized without any considerations
of such a kind.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxvii.</span>&mdash;32. But this is not what we are now inquiring.
Let him rather answer (what he wanders off into the
most irrelevant matter in order to avoid answering) by what
means the conscience of the recipient is cleansed who is unacquainted
with the stain on the conscience of the giver, if the
conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we look for
to cleanse the conscience of the recipient? and from what source
he receives faith who is unwittingly baptized by one that is
faithless, if he that has wittingly received his faith from one
that is faithless, receives not faith but guilt? Omitting, therefore,
his revilings, which he has cast at me without any sound
consideration, let us still notice that he does not say what
we demand in what follows. But I should like to look at
the garrulous mode in which he has set this forth, as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
he were sure to overwhelm us with confusion. "But let us
return," he says, "to that argument of your fancy, whereby
you seem to have represented to yourself in a form of words
the persons you baptize. For since you do not see the truth,
it would have been more seemly to have imagined what was
probable." These words of his own, Petilianus put forth by
way of preface, being about to state the words that I had
used. Then he went on to quote: "Behold, you say, the
faithless man stands ready to baptize, but he who is to be
baptized knows nothing of his faithlessness."<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> He has not
quoted the whole of my proposition and question; and presently
he begins to ask me in his turn, saying, "Who is the
man, and from what corner has he started up, that you propose
to us? Why do you seem to see a man who is the produce
of your imagination, in order to avoid seeing one whom you
are bound to see, and to examine and test most carefully?
But since I see that you are unacquainted with the order of
the sacrament, I tell you this as shortly as I can: you were
bound both to examine your baptizer, and to be examined by
him." What is it, then, that we were waiting for? That he
should tell us by what means the conscience of the recipient
is to be cleansed, who is unacquainted with the stain on the
conscience of him that gives but not in holiness, and whence
the man is to receive not guilt but faith, who has received
baptism unwittingly from one that is faithless. All that we
have heard is that the baptizer ought most diligently to be
examined by him who wishes to receive not guilt but faith,
that the latter may make himself acquainted with the conscience
of him that gives in holiness, which is to cleanse the
conscience of the recipient. For the man that has failed to
make this examination, and has unwittingly received baptism
from one that is faithless, from the very fact that he did not
make the examination, and therefore did not know of the stain
on the conscience of the giver, was incapacitated from receiving
faith instead of guilt. Why therefore did he add what
he made so much of adding,&mdash;the word <i>wittingly</i>, which he
calumniously accused me of having suppressed? For in his
unwillingness that the sentence should run, "He who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
received his faith from one that is faithless, receives not
faith but guilt," he seems to have left some hope to the
man that acts unwittingly. But now, when he is asked
whence that man is to receive faith who is baptized unwittingly
by one that is faithless, he has answered that he
ought to have examined his baptizer; so that, beyond all
doubt, he refuses the wretched man permission even to be
ignorant, by not finding out from what source he may receive
faith, unless he has placed his trust in the man that is
baptizing him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxviii.</span>&mdash;33. This is what we look upon with horror
in your party; this is what the sentence of God condemns,
crying out with the utmost truth and the utmost clearness,
"Cursed be the man that trusteth in man."<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> This is what is
most openly forbidden by holy humility and apostolic love, as
Paul declares, "Let no man glory in men."<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> This is the reason
that the attack of empty calumnies and of the bitterest invectives
grows even fiercer against us, that when human authority
is as it were overthrown, there may remain no ground of
hope for those to whom we administer the word and sacrament
of God in accordance with the dispensation entrusted
unto us. We make answer to them: How long do you rest
your support on man? The venerable society of the Catholic
Church makes answer to them: "Truly my soul waiteth upon
God: from Him cometh my salvation. He only is my rock
and my salvation; He is my defence; I shall not be greatly
moved."<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> For what other reason have they had for removing
from the house of God, except that they pretended that
they could not endure those vessels made to dishonour, from
which the house shall not be free until the day of judgment?
whereas all the time they rather appear, by their deeds and by
the records of the time, to have themselves been vessels of
this kind, while they threw the imputation in the teeth of
others; of which said vessels made unto dishonour, in order
that no one should on their account remove in confusion of
mind from the great house, which alone belongs to the great
Father of our family, the servant of God, one who was good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
and faithful, or was capable of receiving faith in baptism,
as I have shown above, expressly says, "Truly my soul
waiteth upon God" (on God, you see, and not on man):
"from Him cometh my salvation" (not from man). But
Petilianus would refuse to ascribe to God the cleansing and
purifying of a man, even when the stain upon the conscience
of him who gives, but not in holiness, is hidden from view,
and any one receives his faith unwittingly from one that is
faithless, "I tell you this," he says, "as shortly as I can:
you were bound both to examine your baptizer, and to be
examined by him."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxix.</span>&mdash;34. I entreat of you, pay attention to this:
I ask where the means shall be found for cleansing the conscience
of the recipient, when he is not acquainted with the
stain upon the conscience of him that gives but not in holiness,
if the conscience of him that gives in holiness is waited
for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient? and from what
source he is to receive faith, who is unwittingly baptized by one
that is faithless, if whosoever has received his faith wittingly
from one that is faithless, receives not faith but guilt? and
he answers me, that both the baptizer and the baptized should
be subjected to examination. And for the proof of this point,
out of which no question arises, he adduces the example of
John, in that he was examined by those who asked him who
he claimed to be,<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> and that he also in turn examined those to
whom he says, "O generation of vipers, who hath warned you
to flee from the wrath to come?"<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> What has this to do with
the subject? What has this to do with the question under
discussion? God had vouchsafed to John the testimony of
most eminent holiness of life, confirmed by the previous
witness of the noblest prophecy, both when he was conceived,
and when he was born. But the Jews put their question,
already believing him to be a saint, to find out which of the
saints he maintained himself to be, or whether he was himself
the saint of saints, that is, Christ Jesus. So much favour
indeed was shown to him, that credence would at once have
been given to whatever he might have said about himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
If, therefore, we are to follow this precedent in declaring that
each several baptizer is now to be examined, then each must
also be believed, whatever he may say of himself. But who
is there that is made up of deceit, whom we know that the
Holy Spirit flees from, in accordance with the Scripture,<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> who
would not wish the best to be believed of him, or who would
hesitate to bring this about by the use of any words within
his reach? Accordingly, when he shall have been asked
who he is, and shall have answered that he is the faithful
dispenser of God's ordinances, and that his conscience is not
polluted with the stain of any crime, will this be the whole
examination, or will there be a further more careful investigation
into his character and life? Assuredly there will. But
it is not written that this was done by those who asked John
who he was in the desert of Jordan.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxx.</span>&mdash;35. Accordingly this precedent is wholly
without bearing on the matter in hand. We might rather
say that the declaration of the apostle sufficiently inculcates
this care, when he says, "Let these also first be proved;
then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless."<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a>
And since this is done anxiously and habitually in
both parties, by almost all concerned, how comes it that so
many are found to be reprobates subsequently to the time of
having undertaken this ministry, except that, on the one hand,
human care is often deceived, and, on the other hand, those
who have begun well occasionally deteriorate? And since
things of this sort happen so frequently as to allow no man
to hide them or to forget them, what is the reason that Petilianus
now teaches us insultingly, in a few words, that the
baptizer ought to be examined by the candidate for baptism,
since our question is, by what means the conscience of the
recipient is to be cleansed, when the stain on the conscience
of him that gives, but not in holiness, has been concealed
from view, if the conscience of one that gives in holiness is
what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient.
"Since I see," he says, "that you are unacquainted with the
order of the sacrament, I tell you this as shortly as I can:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
you were bound both to examine your baptizer, and to be
examined by him." What an answer to make! He is surrounded
in so many places by such a multitude of men that
have been baptized by ministers who, having in the first
instance seemed righteous and chaste, have subsequently been
convicted and degraded in consequence of the disclosure of their
faults; and he thinks that he is avoiding the force of this
question, in which we ask by what means the conscience of
the recipient is to be cleansed, when he is unacquainted with
the stain upon the conscience of him that gives but not in
holiness, if the conscience of one that gives in holiness is
what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient,&mdash;he
thinks, I say, that he is avoiding the force of this question,
by saying shortly that the baptizer ought to be examined.
Nothing is more unfortunate than not to be consistent with
truth, by which every one is so shut in, that he cannot find a
means of escape. We ask from whom he is to receive faith
who is baptized by one that is faithless? The answer is, "He
ought to have examined his baptizer." Is it therefore the
case that, since he does not examine him, and so even unwittingly
receives his faith from one that is faithless, he receives
not faith but guilt? Why then are those men not baptized
afresh, who are found to have been baptized by men that are
detected and convicted reprobates, while their true character
was yet concealed?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxi.</span>&mdash;36. "And where," he says, "is the word
that I added, <i>wittingly?</i> so that I did not say, He that has
received his faith from one that is faithless; but, He that has
received his faith <i>wittingly</i> from one that is faithless, receives
not faith but guilt." He therefore who received his faith
unwittingly from one that was faithless, received not guilt
but faith; and accordingly I ask from what source he has
received it? And being thus placed in a strait, he answers,
"He ought to have examined him." Granted that he ought
to have done so; but, as a matter of fact, he did not, or he
was not able: what is your verdict about him? Was he
cleansed, or was he not? If he was cleansed, I ask from
what source? For the polluted conscience of him that gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
but not in holiness, with which he was unacquainted, could
not cleanse him. But if he was not cleansed, command that
he be so now. You give no such orders, therefore he
was cleansed. Tell me, by what means? Do you, at any
rate, tell me what Petilianus has failed to tell. For I propose
to you the very same words which he was unable to answer.
"Behold, the faithless man stands ready to baptize; but he
who is to be baptized knows nothing of his faithlessness: what
do you think that he will receive,&mdash;faith, or guilt?"<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> This
is sufficient as a constant form of question: answer, or search
diligently to find what he has answered. You will find abuse
that has already been convicted. He finds fault with me, as
though in derision, maintaining that I ought to suggest what
is probable for consideration, since I cannot see the truth.
For, repeating my words, and cutting my sentence in two, he
says, "Behold, you say, the faithless man stands ready to
baptize; but he who is to be baptized knows nothing of his
faithlessness." Then he goes on to ask, "Who is the man,
and from what corner has he started up, that you propose to
us?" Just as though there were some one or two individuals,
and such cases were not constantly occurring everywhere
on either side! Why does he ask of me who the man
in question is, and from what corner he has started up,
instead of looking round, and seeing that the churches are
few and far between, whether in cities or in country districts,
which do not contain men detected in crimes, and degraded
from the ministry? While their true character was concealed,
while they wished to be thought good, though really
bad, and to be reputed chaste, though really guilty of adultery,
so long they were involved in deceit; and so the Holy Spirit,
according to the Scripture, was fleeing from them.<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> It is
from the crowd, therefore, of these men who hitherto concealed
their character that the faithless man whom I suggested started
up. Why does he ask me whence he started up, shutting
his eyes to all this crowd, from which sufficient noise arises
to satisfy the blind, if we take into consideration none but
those who might have been convicted and degraded from
their office?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxii.</span>&mdash;37. What shall we say of what he himself
advanced in his epistle, that "Quodvultdeus, having been convicted
of two adulteries, and cast out from among you, was
received by those of our party?"<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> What then (I would speak
without prejudice to this man, who proved his case to be a
good one, or at least persuaded men that it was so), when
such men among you, being as yet undetected, administer baptism,
what is received at their hands,&mdash;faith, or guilt? Surely
not faith, because they have not the conscience of one who
gives in holiness to cleanse the conscience of the recipient.
But yet not guilt either, in virtue of that added word: "For
he that has received his faith <i>wittingly</i> from one that is faithless,
receives not faith but guilt." But when men were
baptized by those of whom I speak, they were surely ignorant
what sort of men they were. Furthermore, not receiving
faith from their baptizers, who had not the conscience of one
that gives in holiness, and not receiving guilt, because they
were baptized not knowing but in ignorance of their faults,
they therefore remained without faith and without guilt. They
are not, therefore, in the number of men of such abandoned
character. But neither can they be in the number of the
faithful, because, as they could not receive guilt, so neither
could they receive faith from their baptizers. But we see that
they are reputed by you in the number of the faithful, and
that no one of you declares his opinion that they ought to be
baptized, but all of you hold valid the baptism which they
have already received. They have therefore received faith;
and yet they have not received it from those who had not
the conscience of one that gives in holiness, to cleanse the
conscience of the recipient. Whence then did they receive
it? This is the point from which I make my effort; this is
the question that I press most earnestly; to this I do most
urgently demand an answer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxiii.</span>&mdash;38. See now how Petilianus, to avoid
answering this question, or to avoid being proved to be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>capable
of answering it, wanders off vainly into irrelevant
matter in abuse of us, accusing us and proving nothing; and
when he chances to make an endeavour to resist, with something
like a show of fighting for his cause, he is everywhere
overcome with the greatest ease. But yet he nowhere gives an
answer of any kind to this one question which we ask: If the
conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we look for
to cleanse the conscience of the recipient, by what means is
he to be cleansed who received baptism while the conscience
of the giver was polluted, without the knowledge of him who
was to receive it? for in these words, which he quoted from
my epistle, he set me forth as asking a question, while he
showed himself as giving no answer. For after saying what
I have just now recited, and when, on being brought into a
great strait on every side, he had been compelled to say that
the baptizer ought to be examined by the candidate for baptism,
and the candidate in turn by the baptizer; and when he
had tried to fortify this statement by the example of John, in
hopes that he might find auditors either of the greatest negligence
or of the greatest ignorance, he then went on to advance
other testimonies of Scripture wholly irrelevant to the matter
in hand, as the saying of the eunuch to Philip, "See, here is
water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?"<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> "inasmuch as
he knew," says he, "that those of abandoned character were
prevented;" arguing that the reason why Philip did not forbid
him to be baptized was because he had proved, in his reading
of the Scriptures, how far he believed in Christ,&mdash;as though he
had prohibited Simon Magus. And again, he urges that the
prophets were afraid of being deceived by false baptism, and
that therefore Isaiah said, "Lying water that has not faith,"<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a>
as though showing that water among faithless men is lying;
whereas it is not Isaiah but Jeremiah that says this of lying
men, calling the people in a figure water, as is most clearly
shown in the Apocalypse.<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> And again, he quotes as words of
David, "Let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head,"
when David has been speaking of the flattery of the smooth
speaker deceiving with false praise, so as to lead the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
the man praised to wax great with pride. And this meaning
is made manifest by the words immediately preceding in the
same psalm. For he says, "Let the righteous smite me, it
shall be a kindness; and let him reprove me: but the oil of the
sinner shall not break my head."<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> What can be clearer than
this sentence? what more manifest? For he declares that he
had rather be reproved in kindness with the sharp correction of
the righteous, so that he may be healed, than anointed with the
soft speaking of the flatterer, so as to be puffed up with pride.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxiv.</span>&mdash;39. Petilianus quotes also the warning of
the Apostle John, that we should not believe every spirit, but
try the spirits whether they are of God,<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> as though this care
should be bestowed in order that the wheat should be separated
from the chaff in this present world before its time, and not
rather for fear that the wheat should be deceived by the
chaff; or as though, even if the lying spirit should have said
something that was true, it was to be denied, because the spirit
whom we should abominate had said it. But if any one
thinks this, he is mad enough to contend that Peter ought not
to have said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
God,"<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a> because the devils had already said something to the
same effect.<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> Seeing, therefore, that the baptism of Christ,
whether administered by an unrighteous or a righteous man,
is nothing but the baptism of Christ, what a cautious man and
faithful Christian should do is to avoid the unrighteousness of
man, not to condemn the sacraments of God.</p>

<p>40. Assuredly in all these things Petilianus gives no
answer to the question, If the conscience of one that gives in
holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the
recipient, by what means is he to be cleansed who receives
baptism, when the conscience of the giver is polluted without
the knowledge of the proposed recipient? A certain Cyprian,
a colleague of his from Thubursicubur, was caught in a brothel
with a woman of most abandoned character, and was brought
before Primianus of Carthage, and condemned. Now, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
this man baptized before he was detected and condemned, it
is manifest that he had not the conscience of one that gives
in holiness, so as to cleanse the conscience of the recipient.
By what means then have they been cleansed, who at this
day, after he has been condemned, are certainly not washed
again? It was not necessary to name the man, save only to
prevent Petilianus from repeating, "Who is the man, and from
what corner has he started up, that you propose to us?" Why
did not your party examine that baptizer, as John, in the
opinion of Petilianus, was examined? Or was the real fact
this, that they examined him so far as man can examine man,
but were unable to find him out, as he long lay hid with cunning
falseness?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxv.</span>&mdash;Was the water administered by this man
not lying? or is the oil of the fornicator not the oil of the
sinner? or must we hold what the Catholic Church says, and
what is true, that that water and that oil are not his by whom
they were administered, but His whose name was then invoked?
Why did they who were baptized by that hypocrite,
whose sins were concealed, fail to try the spirit, to prove that
it was not of God? For the Holy Spirit of discipline was
even then fleeing from the hypocrite.<a name="FNanchor_1108_1108" id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> Was it that He was
fleeing from him, but at the same time not deserting His
sacraments, though ministered by him? Lastly, since you do
not deny that those men have been already cleansed, whom
you take no care to have cleansed now that he is condemned,
see whether, after shedding over the subject so many mists in
so many different ways, Petilianus, after all, in any place gives
any answer to the question by what means these men have
been cleansed, if what we look for to cleanse the conscience
of the recipient is the conscience of one that gives in holiness,
such as the man who was secretly unclean could not
have had.</p>

<p>41. Making, then, no answer to this which is so urgently
asked of him, and, in the next place, even seeking for himself
a latitude of speech, he says, "Since both prophets and
apostles have been cautious enough to fear these things, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
what face do you say that the baptism of the sinner is holy
to those who believe with a good conscience?" Just as
though I or any Catholic maintained that that baptism was
of the sinner which is administered or received with a sinner
to officiate, instead of being His in virtue of belief in whose
name the candidate is baptized! Then he goes off to an invective
against the traitor Judas, saying against him whatever
he can, quoting the testimony of the prophets uttered concerning
him so long a time before, as though he would steep
the Church of Christ dispersed throughout the world, whose
cause is involved in this discussion, in the impiety of the
traitor Judas,&mdash;not considering what this very thing should
have recalled to his mind, that we ought no more to doubt
that that is the Church of Christ which is spread abroad
throughout the world, since this was prophesied with truth so
many years before, than we ought to doubt that it was necessary
that Christ should be betrayed by one of His disciples,
because this was prophesied in like manner.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxvi.</span>&mdash;42. But after this, when Petilianus came to
that objection of ours, that they allowed the baptism of the followers
of Maximianus, whom they had condemned,<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a>&mdash;although
in the statement of this question he thought it right to use his
own words rather than mine; for neither do we assert that
the baptism of sinners is of profit to us, seeing that we maintain
it to belong not only to no sinners, but to no men whatsoever,
in that we are satisfied that it is Christ's alone,&mdash;having
put the question in this form, he says, "Yet you obstinately
aver that it is right that the baptism of sinners should be of
profit to you, because we too, according to your statement,
maintained the baptism of criminals whom we justly condemned."
When he came to this question, as I said before,
even all the show of fight which he had made deserted him.
He could not find any way to go, any means of escape, any
path by which, either through subtle watching or bold enterprise,
he could either secretly steal away, or sally forth by
force. "Although this," he says, "I will demonstrate in my
second book, how great the difference is between those of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
party and those of yours whom you call innocent, yet, in the
meantime, first extricate yourselves from the offences with
which you are acquainted in your colleagues, and then seek
out the mode of dealing with those whom we cast out." Would
any one, any man upon the earth, give an answer like this,
save one who is setting himself against the truth, against
which he cannot find any answer that can be made? Accordingly,
if we too were to use the same words: In the meantime,
first extricate yourselves from the offences with which
you are acquainted in your colleagues, and then bring up
against us any charge connected with those whom you hold
to be wicked amongst us,&mdash;what is the result? Have we both
won the victory, or are we both defeated? Nay, rather He
has gained the victory for His Church and in His Church,
who has taught us in His Scriptures that no man should glory
in men, and that he that glorieth should glory in the Lord.<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a>
For behold in our case, who assert with the eloquence of
truth that the man who believes is not justified by him by
whom he is baptized, but by Him of whom it is written, "To
him that believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his
faith is counted for righteousness,"<a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> since we do not glory in
men, and strive, when we glory, to glory in the Lord in virtue
of His own gift, how wholly safe are we, whatever fault or
charge Petilianus may have been able to prove concerning
certain men of our communion! For among us, whatever
wicked men are either wholly undetected, or, being known to
certain persons, are yet tolerated for the sake of the bond of
unity and peace, in consideration of other good men to whom
their wickedness is unknown, and before whom they could
not be convicted, in order that the wheat may not be rooted
up together with the tares, yet they so bear the burden of
their own wickedness, that no one shares it with them except
those who are pleased with their unrighteousness. Nor indeed
have we any apprehension that those whom they baptize
cannot be justified, since they believe in Him that justifieth the
ungodly, that their faith may be counted for righteousness.<a name="FNanchor_1111_1111" id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxvii.</span>&mdash;43. Furthermore, according to our tenets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
neither he of whom Petilianus said that he was cast forth by
us for the sin of the men of Sodom, another being appointed
in his place, and that afterwards he was actually restored to
our college,&mdash;talking all the time without knowing what he
was saying,&mdash;nor he whom he declares to have been penitent
among you, in whatever degree their respective cases do or do
not admit of any defence, can either of them prejudice the
Church, which is spread abroad throughout all nations, and
increases in the world until the harvest. For if they were
really wicked members of it that you accuse, then they were
already not in it, but among the chaff; but if they are good,
while you defame their character with unrighteous accusations,
they are themselves being tried like gold, while you burn
after the similitude of chaff. Yet the sins of other men do
not defile the Church, which is spread abroad throughout the
whole world, according to most faithful prophecies, waiting for
the end of the world as for its shore, on which, when it is
landed, it will be freed from the bad fish, in company with
which the inconvenience of nature might be borne without
sin within the same nets of the Lord, so long as it was not
right to be impatiently separated from them. Nor yet is the
discipline of the Church on this account neglected by constant
and diligent and prudent ministers of Christ, in whose province
crimes are in such wise brought to light that they cannot
be defended on any plea of probability. Innumerable
proofs of this may be found in those who have been bishops
or clergy of the second degree of orders, and now, being
degraded, have either gone abroad into other lands through
shame, or have gone over to you yourselves or to other
heresies, or are known in their own districts; of whom there
is so great a multitude dispersed throughout the earth, that if
Petilianus, bridling for a time his rashness in speaking, had
taken them into consideration, he would never have fallen
into so manifestly false and groundless a misconception, as to
think that we ought to join in what he says: None of you is
free from guilt, where no one that is guilty is condemned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxviii.</span>&mdash;44. For, to pass over others dwelling in
different quarters of the earth,&mdash;for you will scarcely find any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
place in which this kind of men is not represented, from whom
it may appear that overseers and ministers are wont to be
condemned even in the Catholic Church,&mdash;we need not look
far to find the example of Honorius of Milevis. But take
the case of Splendonius, whom Petilianus ordained priest after
he had been condemned in the Catholic Church, and rebaptized
by himself, whose condemnation in Gaul, communicated
to us by our brethren, our colleague Fortunatus caused to be
publicly read in Constantina, and whom the same Petilianus
afterwards cast forth on experience of his abominable deceit.
From the case of this Splendonius, when was there a time
when he might not have been reminded after what fashion
wicked men are degraded from their office even in the Catholic
Church? I wonder on what precipice of rashness his heart
was resting when he dictated those words in which he ventured
to say, "No one of you is free from guilt, where no one
that is guilty is condemned." Wherefore the wicked, being
bodily intermingled with the good, but spiritually separated
from them in the Catholic Church, both when they are
undetected through the infirmity of human nature, and when
they are condemned from considerations of discipline, in every
case bear their own burden. And in this way those are free
from danger who are baptized by them with the baptism of
Christ, if they keep free from share in their sins either by
imitation or consent; seeing that in like manner, if they were
baptized by the best of men, they would not be justified except
by Him that justifieth the ungodly: since to those that
believe on Him that justifieth the ungodly their faith is
counted for righteousness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xxxix.</span>&mdash;45. But as for you, when the case of the
followers of Maximianus is brought up against you, who, after
being condemned by the sentence of a Council of 310 bishops;<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a>
after being utterly defeated in the same Council, quoted in the
records of so many proconsuls, in the chronicles of so many
municipal towns; after being driven forth from the basilicas
of which they were in possession, by the order of the judges,
enforced by the troops of the several cities, were yet again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
received with all honour by you, together with those whom
they had baptized outside the pale of your communion, without
any question respecting their baptism,&mdash;when confronted,
I say, with their case, you can find no reply to make. Indeed,
you are vanquished by an expressed opinion, not indeed true,
but proceeding from yourselves, by which you maintain that
men perish for the faults of others in the same communion of
the sacraments, and that each man's character is determined
by that of the man by whom he is baptized,&mdash;that he is guilty
if his baptizer is guilty, innocent if he is innocent. But if
these views are true, there can be no doubt that, to say nothing
of innumerable others, you are destroyed by the sins of the
followers of Maximianus, whose guilt your party, in so large
a Council, has exaggerated even to the proportions of the sin
of those whom the earth swallowed up alive. But if the
faults of the followers of Maximianus have not destroyed
you, then are these opinions false which you entertain; and
much less have certain indefinite unproved faults of the
Africans been able to destroy the entire world. And accordingly,
as the apostle says, "Every man shall bear his own
burden;"<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> and the baptism of Christ is no one's except
Christ's; and it is to no purpose that Petilianus promises that
he will take as the subject of his second book the charges
which we bring concerning the followers of Maximianus,
entertaining too low an opinion of men's intellects, as though
they do not perceive that he has nothing to say.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xl.</span>&mdash;46. For if the baptism which Pr√¶textatus and
Felicianus administered in the communion of Maximianus
was their own, why was it received by you in those whom
they baptized as though it were the baptism of Christ? But
if it is truly the baptism of Christ, as indeed it is, and yet
could not profit those who had received it with the guilt of
schism, what do you say that you could have granted to those
whom you have received into your body with the same baptism,
except that, now that the offence of their accursed division
is wiped out by the bond of peace, they should not be
compelled to receive the sacrament of the holy laver as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
they had it not, but that, as what they had was before for
their destruction, so it should now begin to be of profit to
them? Or if this is not granted to them in your communion,
because it could not possibly be that it should be granted
to schismatics among schismatics, it is at any rate granted to
you in the Catholic communion, not that you should receive
baptism as though it were lacking in you, but that the baptism
which you have actually received should be of profit to
you. For all the sacraments of Christ, if not combined with
the love which belongs to the unity of Christ, are possessed
not unto salvation, but unto judgment. But since it is not a
true verdict, but your verdict, "that through the baptism of
certain <i>traditors</i> the baptism of Christ has perished from the
world in general," it is with good reason that you cannot find
any answer to make respecting the recognition of the baptism
of the followers of Maximianus.</p>

<p>47. See therefore, and remember with the most watchful
care, how Petilianus has made no answer to that very question,
which he proposes to himself in such terms as to seem to
make it a starting-point from which to say something. For
the former question he has dismissed altogether, and has not
wished to speak of it to us, because I suppose it was beyond
his power; nor is he at any time, up to the very end of his
volume, going to say anything about it, though he quoted it
from the first part of my epistle as though it were a matter
calling for refutation. For even though he has added the two
words which he accused me of having suppressed, as though
they were the strongest bulwarks of his position, he yet lies
wholly defenceless, unable to find any answer to make when
he is asked, If the conscience of one that gives in holiness is
what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient,
where are we to find means for cleansing the conscience of the
man who is unacquainted with the conscience of him that
gives, but not in holiness? and if it be the case that any one
who has received his faith from one that is faithless, receives
not faith but guilt, from what source is he to receive not
guilt but faith, who is unwittingly baptized by one that is
faithless? To this question it has long been manifest from
what he says that he has made no answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span></p>

<p>48. In the next place, he has gone on, with calumnious
mouth, to abuse monasteries and monks, finding fault also with
me, as having been the founder of this kind of life.<a name="FNanchor_1114_1114" id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a> And
what this kind of life really is he does not know at all, or
rather, though it is perfectly well known throughout all the
world, he pretends that he is unacquainted with it. Then,
asserting that I had said that Christ was the baptizer, he has
also added certain words from my epistle as though I had set
this forth as my own sentiment, when I had really quoted it
as his and yours, as I will presently show clearly to the best
of my ability.<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> Then he has endeavoured to show us, in many
unnecessary words, that Christ does not baptize, but that baptism
is administered in His name, at once in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; of which Trinity
itself he has said, either because it was what he wished,
or because it was all that he could say, that "Christ is the
centre of the Trinity." In the next place, he has taken
occasion of the names of the sorcerers Simon and Barjesus to
vent against us what insults he thought fit. Then he goes
on, keeping in guarded suspense the case of Optatus of
Thamugas, that he might not be steeped in the odium that
arose from it, denying that either he or his party could have
passed judgment upon him, and actually intimating in respect
of him, that he was crushed in consequence of suggestions
from myself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xli.</span>&mdash;49. Lastly, he has ended his epistle with an
exhortation and warning to his own party, that they should
not be deceived by us, and with a lamentation over those of
our party, that we had made them worse than they had been
before. Having therefore carefully considered and discussed
these points, as appears with sufficient clearness from the
words of the epistle which he wrote, Petilianus has made no
answer at all to the position which I advanced to begin with
in my epistle, when I asked, Supposing it to be true, as he
asserts, that the conscience of one that gives&mdash;or rather, to add
what he considers so great a support to his argument&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
the conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we look
for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient, by what means
he who receives baptism is to be cleansed, when, if the conscience
of the giver is polluted, it is without the knowledge of
the proposed recipient? Whence it is not surprising that a
man resisting in the cause of falsehood, pressed hard in the
straits of the truth that contradicts it, should have chosen
rather to gasp forth mad abuse, than to walk in the path of
that truth which cannot be overcome.</p>

<p>50. And now I would beg of you to pay especial attention
to the next few words, that I may show you clearly what he
has been afraid of in not answering this, and that I may bring
into the light what he has endeavoured to shroud in obscurity.
It certainly was in his power, when we asked by what
means he is to be cleansed, who receives baptism when the
conscience of the giver is polluted without the knowledge of
the proposed recipient, to answer with the greatest ease, From
our Lord God; and at any rate to say with the utmost confidence,
God wholly cleanses the conscience of the recipient,
when he is unacquainted with the stain upon the conscience
of him that gives but not in holiness. But when a man had
already been compelled by the tenets of your sect to rest the
cleansing of the recipient on the conscience of the giver, in
that he had said, "For the conscience of him that gives," or
"of him that gives in holiness, is looked for to cleanse the
conscience of the recipient," he was naturally afraid lest any
one should seem to be better baptized by a wicked man who
concealed his wickedness, than by one that was genuinely and
manifestly good; for in the former case his cleansing would
depend not on the conscience of one that gave in holiness,
but on the most excellent holiness of God Himself. With
this apprehension, therefore, that he might not be involved in
so great an absurdity, or rather madness, as not to know where
he could make his escape, he was unwilling to say by what
means the conscience of the recipient should be cleansed,
when he does not know of the stain upon the conscience of
him that gives but not in holiness; and he thought it better,
by making a general confusion with his quarrelsome uproar, to
conceal what was asked of him, than to give a reply to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
question, which should at once discomfit him; never, however,
thinking that our letter could be read by men of such good
understanding, or that his would be read by those who had
read ours as well, to which he has professed to make an
answer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xlii.</span>&mdash;51. For what I just now said is put with the
greatest clearness in that very epistle of mine, in answering
which he has said nothing; and I would beg of you to listen
for a few moments to what he there has done. And although
you are partisans of his, and hate us, yet, if you can, bear it
with equanimity. For in his former epistle, to the first portion
of which&mdash;the only portion which had then come into our
hands&mdash;I had in the first instance made my reply, he had so
rested the hope that is found in baptism in the baptizer, as to
say, "For everything consists of an origin and root; and if
anything has not a head, it is nothing." Since then Petilianus
had said this, not wishing anything to be understood by the
origin and root and head of baptizing a man, except the man
by whom he might be baptized, I made a comment, and
said: "We ask, therefore, in a case where the faithlessness of
the baptizer is undetected, if then the man whom he baptizes
receives faith and not guilt? if then the baptizer is not his
origin and root and head, who is it from whom he receives
faith? where is the origin from which he springs? where is
the root of which he is a shoot? where the head which is his
starting-point? Can it be that, when he who is baptized is
unaware of the faithlessness of his baptizer, it is then Christ
who is the origin and root and head?" This therefore I say
and exclaim now also, as I did there as well: "Alas for
human rashness and conceit! Why do you not allow that it
is always Christ who gives faith, for the purpose of making a
man a Christian by giving it? Why do you not allow that
Christ is always the origin of the Christian, that the Christian
always plants his root in Christ, that Christ is the Head of the
Christian? Will it then be urged that, even where spiritual
grace is dispensed to those that believe by the hands of a
holy and faithful minister, it is still not the minister himself
who justifies, but that One of whom it is said, 'He justifieth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
the ungodly?'<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> But unless we admit this, either the Apostle
Paul was the head and origin of those whom he had planted,
or Apollos the root of those whom he had watered, rather
than He who had given them faith in believing; whereas the
same Paul says, 'I have planted, Apollos watered; but God
gave the increase. So that neither is he that planteth anything,
nor he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.'<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a>
Nor was the apostle himself their root, but rather He who
says, 'I am the vine, ye are the branches.'<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> How, too, could
he be their head, when he says that 'we, being many, are one
body in Christ,'<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> and expressly declares in many passages that
Christ Himself is the Head of the whole body? Wherefore,
whether a man receive the sacrament of baptism from a faithful
or a faithless minister, his whole hope is in Christ, that he
fall not under the condemnation, that 'Cursed is he that
placeth his hope in man!'"<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xliii.</span>&mdash;52. These things, I think, I put with clearness
and truth in my former epistle, when I made answer to
Petilianus. These things I have also now quoted, intimating
and commending to you the truth that our faith rests on
something else altogether than man, and that we believe that
the Lord Christ is the cleanser and the justifier of men that
believe in Him that justifieth the ungodly, that their faith
may be counted unto them for righteousness, whether the man
who administers the baptism be righteous, or such an impious
and deceitful man as the Holy Spirit flees. Then I went on
to point out what absurdity would follow were it otherwise,
and I said, as I say now: "Otherwise, if each man is born again
in spiritual grace of the same sort as he by whom he is baptized,
and if, when he who baptizes him is manifestly a good
man, then he himself gives faith, he is himself the origin and
root and head of him who is being born; whilst, when the
baptizer is faithless without its being known, then the baptized
person receives faith from Christ, then he derives his
origin from Christ, then he is rooted in Christ, then he boasts
in Christ as his head; in that case all who are baptized should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
wish that they might have faithless baptizers, and be ignorant
of their faithlessness. For however good their baptizers might
have been, Christ is certainly beyond comparison better still,
and He will then be the Head of the baptized if the faithlessness
of the baptizer shall escape detection. But if it be perfect
madness to hold such a view (for it is Christ always that
justifieth the ungodly, by changing his ungodliness into Christianity;
it is from Christ always that faith is received; Christ
is always the origin of the regenerate, and the Head of the
Church), what weight then will those words have, which
thoughtless readers value by their sound, without inquiring
what their inner meaning is?"<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> This much I said at that
time; this is written in my epistle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xliv.</span>&mdash;53. Then a little after, as he had said, "This
being so, brethren, what perversity must that be, that he who
is guilty by reason of his own faults should make another free
from guilt, whereas the Lord Jesus Christ says, 'Every good
tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth
evil fruit: do men gather grapes of thorns?'<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> and again,
'A good man, out of the good treasure of the heart, bringeth
forth good things: and an evil man, out of the evil treasure,
bringeth forth evil things,'"<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a>&mdash;by which words Petilianus
showed with sufficient clearness, that the man who baptizes
is to be looked on as the tree, and he who is baptized as the
fruit: to this I had answered, If the good tree is the good
baptizer, and his good fruit he whom he has baptized, then
any one who has been baptized by a bad man, even if his
wickedness be not manifest, cannot by any possibility be good,
for he is sprung from an evil tree. For a good tree is one
thing; a tree whose quality is concealed, but yet bad, is another.
What else did I wish to be understood by those words, except
what I had stated a little above, that the tree and its fruit
do not represent him that baptizes and him that is baptized;
but that the man ought to be received as signified by the
tree, his works and his life by the fruit, which are always
good in the good man, and evil in the evil man, lest this
absurdity should follow, that a man should be bad when bap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>tized
by a bad man, even though his wickedness were concealed,
being, as it were, the fruit of a tree whose quality was
unknown, but yet bad? To which he has answered nothing
whatsoever.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xlv.</span>&mdash;54. But that neither he nor any one of you
might say that, when any one of concealed bad character is
the baptizer, then he whom he baptizes is not his fruit, but
the fruit of Christ, I went on immediately to point out
what a foolish error is consequent also on that opinion; and
I repeated, though in other words, what I had said shortly
before: If, when the quality of the tree is concealed, but evil,
any one who may have been baptized by it is born, not of it,
but of Christ, then they are justified with greater holiness
who are baptized by wicked men, whose wickedness is concealed,
than they who are baptized by men that are genuinely
and manifestly good.<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> Petilianus then, being hemmed in by
these embarrassing straits, said nothing about the earlier part
on which these remarks depended, and in his answer so quoted
this absurd consequence of his error as though I had stated
it as my own opinion, whereas it was really stated in order
that he might perceive the amount of evil consequent on his
opinion, and so be forced to alter it. Imposing, therefore, this
deceit on those who hear and read his words, and never for a
moment supposing that what we have written could be read,
he begins a vehement and petulant invective against me, as
though I had thought that all who are baptized ought to wish
that they might have as their baptizers men who are faithless,
without knowing this themselves, since, however good
the men might be whom they had to baptize them, Christ is
incomparably better, who will then be the head of the person
baptized, if the faithless baptizer conceal his true character.
As though, too, I had thought that those were justified with
greater holiness who are baptized by evil men, whose character
is concealed, than those who are baptized by men that are
genuinely and manifestly good; when this marvellous piece
of madness was only mentioned by me as following necessarily
on the opinion of those who think with Petilianus, that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
man, when baptized, bears the same relation to his baptizer
as fruit does to the tree from which it springs,&mdash;good fruit
springing from a good tree, evil fruit from an evil tree,&mdash;seeing
that they, when they are bidden by me to answer whose
fruit they think a man that is baptized to be when he is
baptized by one of secretly bad character, since they do not
venture to rebaptize him, are compelled to answer, that then
he is not the fruit of that man of secretly bad character, but
that he is the fruit of Christ. And so they are followed by a
consequence contrary to their inclination, which none but a
madman would entertain,&mdash;that if a man is the fruit of his
baptizer when he is baptized by one that is genuinely and
manifestly good, but when he is baptized by one of secretly bad
character, he is then not his fruit, but the fruit of Christ,&mdash;it cannot
but follow that they are justified with greater holiness who
are baptized by men of secretly bad character, than those who
are baptized by men who are genuinely and manifestly good.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xlvi.</span>&mdash;55. Now, seeing that when Petilianus attributes
this to me as though it were my opinion, he makes it an
occasion for a serious and vehement invective against me, he
at any rate shows, by the very force of his indignation, how
great a sin it is in his opinion to entertain such views; and,
accordingly, whatever he has wished it to appear that he said
against me for holding this opinion will be found to have
been really said against himself, who is proved to entertain the
view. For he shows herein by how great force on the side
of truth he is overcome, when he cannot find any other door
of escape except to pretend that it was I who entertained the
views which really are his own. Just as if those whom the
apostle confutes for maintaining that there was no resurrection
from the dead, were to wish to bring an accusation against
the same apostle, on the ground that he said, "Then is Christ
not risen," and to maintain that the preaching of the apostle
was vain, and the faith of those who believed in it was also
vain, and that false witnesses were found against God in those
who had said that He raised up Christ from the dead. This
is what Petilianus wished to do to me, never expecting that
any one could read what I had written, which he could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
answer, though very anxious that men should believe him
to have answered it. But just as, if any one had done this
to the apostle, the whole calumnious accusation would have
recoiled on the head of those who made it so soon as the
entire passage in his epistle was read, and the preceding
words restored, on which any one who reads them must perceive
that those which I have quoted depend, in the same
way, so soon as the preceding words of my epistle are restored,
the accusation which Petilianus brings against me is cast back
with all the greater force upon his own head, from which he
had striven to remove it.</p>

<p>56. For the apostle, in confuting those who denied that
there was any resurrection of the dead, corrects their view by
showing the absurdity which follows those who entertain this
view, however loth they may be to admit the consequence, in
order that, while they shrink in abhorrence from what is impious
to say, they may correct what they have ventured to
believe. His argument continues thus: "But if there be
no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: and if
Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith
is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God:
because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ;
whom He raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not,"<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a>
in order that, while they fear to say that Christ had not
risen, with the other wicked and accursed conclusions which
follow from such a statement, they may correct what they
said in a spirit of folly and infidelity, that there is no resurrection
of the dead. If, therefore, you take away what stands
at the head of this argument, "<i>If</i> there be no resurrection
of the dead," the rest is spoken amiss, and yet must be
ascribed to the apostle. But if you restore the supposition
on which the rest depends, and place as the hypothesis from
which you start, "There is no resurrection of the dead," then
the conclusion will follow rightly, "Then is Christ not risen,
and our preaching is vain, and your faith is also vain," with
all the rest that is appended to it. And all these statements
of the apostle are wise and good, since whatever evil they
have in them is to be imputed to those who denied the resur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>rection
of the dead. In the same manner also, in my epistle,
take away my supposition, If every one is born again in
spiritual grace of the same character as he by whom he is
baptized, and if, when the man who baptizes is genuinely and
manifestly good, he does of himself give faith, he is the origin
and root and head of him who is being born again; but when
the baptizer is a wicked man, and undetected in his wickedness,
then each man who is baptized receives his faith from
Christ, derives his origin from Christ, is rooted in Christ,
makes his boast in Christ as his Head:&mdash;take away, I say,
this hypothesis, on which all that follows depends, and there
remains a saying of the worst description which must fairly
be ascribed to me, viz., that all who are baptized should desire
that they should have faithless men to baptize them, and be
ignorant of their faithlessness. For however good men they
may have to baptize them, Christ is incomparably better, who
will then be the Head of the baptized, if the baptizer be a
faithless man, but undetected.<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> But let the statements that
you make be restored, and then it will forthwith be found
that this which depends upon it and follows in close connection
from it is not my sentiment, and that any evil which
it contains is retorted on the opinion which you maintain.
In like manner, take away the supposition, If the good baptizer
is the good tree, so that he whom he has baptized is his
good fruit, and if, when the character of an evil tree is concealed,
then any one that has been baptized by it is born, not
of it, but of Christ,&mdash;take away this hypothesis, which you
were compelled to confess had its origin in your sect and in
the letter of Petilianus, and the mad conclusion which follows
from it will be mine, to be ascribed to me alone, Then they are
justified with greater holiness who are baptized by undetected
evil men, than they who are baptized by men that are genuinely
and manifestly good.<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> But restore the hypothesis on which
this depends, and you will at once see both that I have been
right in making this statement for your correction, and that
all that with good reason displeases you in this opinion has
recoiled upon your own head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xlvii.</span>&mdash;57. Furthermore, in like manner as those
who denied the resurrection of the dead could in no way
defend themselves from the evil consequences which the
apostle proved to follow from their premises, in order to
refute their error, saying, "Then is not Christ raised," with
the other conclusions of similar atrocity, unless they changed
their opinions, and acknowledged that there was a resurrection
of the dead; so is it necessary that you should change your
opinion, and cease to rest on man the hope of those who are
baptized, if you do not wish to have imputed to you what we
say for your refutation and correction, that they are justified
with greater holiness who are baptized by undetected evil
men than those that are baptized by men that are genuinely
and manifestly good. For if you make your first assertion,
see what I say, unless some one shall suppress this a second
time, and make out that I have entertained the opinion which
I quote for your refutation and correction. See what I lay
down as my premiss, from which hangs the statement which I
shall subsequently make: If you rest the hope of those who
are to be baptized on the man by whom they are baptized,
and if you maintain, as Petilianus wrote, that the man who
baptizes is the origin and root and head of him that is baptized;
if you receive as the good tree the good man who baptizes,
and as his good fruit the man who has been baptized by
him; then you put it into our heads to ask from what origin
he springs, from what root he shoots up, to what head he is
joined, from what tree he is born, who is baptized by an
undetected bad man? For to this inquiry belongs also the
following, to which I have over and over again maintained
that Petilianus has given no reply: By what means is a man
to be cleansed who receives baptism while he is ignorant of
the stain upon the conscience of him that gives but not in
holiness? for this conscience of him that gives, or of him that
gives in holiness, Petilianus wishes to be the origin, root, head,
seed, tree from which the sanctification of the baptized has its
existence,&mdash;springs, begins, sprouts forth, is born.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xlviii.</span>&mdash;58. When we ask, therefore, by what means
the man is to be cleansed whom you do not baptize again in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
your communion, even when it has been made clear that he
has been baptized by some one who, on account of some concealed
iniquity, did not at the time possess the conscience of
one that gives in holiness, what answer do you intend to make,
except that he is cleansed by Christ or by God, although,
indeed, Christ is Himself God over all, blessed for ever,<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a> or
by the Holy Spirit, since He too is Himself God, because this
Trinity of Persons is one God? Whence Peter, after saying
to a man, "Thou hast dared to lie to the Holy Ghost," immediately
went on to add what was the nature of the Holy Ghost,
saying, "Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God."<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a> Lastly,
even if you were to say that he was cleansed and purified by
an angel when he is unacquainted with the pollution in the
conscience of him that gives but not in holiness, take notice
that it is said of the saints, when they shall have risen to
eternal life, that they shall then be equal to the angels of
God.<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> Any one, therefore, that is cleansed even by an angel
is cleansed with greater holiness than if he were cleansed by
any kind of conscience of man. Why then are you unwilling
that it should be said to you, If cleansing is wrought by the
hands of a man when he is genuinely and manifestly good;
but when the man is evil, but undetected in his wickedness,
then since he has not the conscience of one that gives in
holiness, it is no longer he, but God, or an angel, that cleanses;
therefore they who are baptized by undetected evil men are
justified with greater holiness than those who are baptized by
men that are genuinely and manifestly good? And if this
opinion is displeasing to you, as in reality it ought to be displeasing
to every one, then take away the source from which
it springs, correct the premiss to which it is indissolubly
bound; for if these do not precede as hypotheses, the other
will not follow as a consequence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xlix.</span>&mdash;59. Do not therefore any longer say, "The
conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we look for
to cleanse the conscience of the recipient," lest you be asked,
When a stain on the conscience of the giver is concealed, who
cleanses the conscience of the recipient? And when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
shall have answered, Either God or an angel (since there is
no other answer which you possibly can make), then should
follow a consequence whereby you would be confounded:
Those then are justified with greater holiness who are baptized
by undetected evil men, so as to be cleansed by God or by an
angel, than those who are baptized by men who are genuinely
and manifestly good, who cannot be compared with God or with
the angels. But prevail upon yourselves to say what is said
by Truth and by the Catholic Church, that not only when the
minister of baptism is evil, but also when he is holy and good,
hope is still not to be placed in man, but in Him that justifieth
the ungodly, in whom if any man believe, his faith is
counted for righteousness.<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> For when we say, Christ baptizes,
we do not mean by a visible ministry, as Petilianus believes,
or would have men think that he believes, to be our meaning,
but by a hidden grace, by a hidden power in the Holy Spirit,
as it is said of Him by John the Baptist, "The same is He
which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> Nor has He, as
Petilianus says, now ceased to baptize; but He still does it,
not by any ministry of the body, but by the invisible working
of His majesty. For in that we say, He Himself baptizes, we
do not mean, He Himself holds and dips in the water the
bodies of the believers; but He Himself invisibly cleanses,
and that He does to the whole Church without exception.
Nor, indeed, may we refuse to believe the words of the Apostle
Paul, who says concerning Him, "Husbands, love your wives,
even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave Himself for it,
that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of
water by the word."<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> Here you see that Christ sanctifies;
here you see that Christ also Himself washes, Himself
purifies with the self-same washing of water by the word,
wherein the ministers are seen to do their work in the
body. Let no one, therefore, claim unto himself what is
of God. The hope of men is only sure when it is fixed on
Him who cannot deceive, since "Cursed be the man that
trusteth in man,"<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a> and "Blessed is that man that maketh the
Lord His trust."<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> For the faithful steward shall receive as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
his reward eternal life; but the unfaithful steward, when he
dispenses his lord's provisions to his fellow-servants, must in
no wise be conceived to make the provisions useless by his
own unfaithfulness. For the Lord says, "Whatsoever they
bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after
their works."<a name="FNanchor_1136_1136" id="FNanchor_1136_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> And this is therefore the injunction that is
given us against evil stewards, that the good things of God
should be received at their hands, but that we should beware
of their own evil life, by reason of its unlikeness to what they
thus dispense.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. l.</span>&mdash;60. But if it is clear that Petilianus has made
no answer to those first words of my epistle, and that, when
he has endeavoured to make an answer, he has shown all the
more clearly how incapable he was of answering, what shall I
say in respect of those portions of my writings which he has
not even attempted to answer, on which he has not touched
at all? And yet if any one shall be willing to review their
character, having in his possession both my writings and those
of Petilianus, I think he will understand by what confirmation
they are supported. And that I may show you this as shortly
as I can, I would beg you to call to mind the proofs that were
advanced from holy Scripture, or refresh your memory by
reading both what he has brought forward as against me, and
what I have brought forward in my answer as against you,
and see how I have shown that the passages which he has
brought forward are antagonistic not to me, but rather to
yourselves; whilst he has altogether failed to touch those
which I brought forward as especially necessary, and in that
one passage of the apostle which he has endeavoured to make
use of as though it favoured him, you will see how he found
himself without the means of making his escape.</p>

<p>61. For the portion of this epistle which he wrote to his
adherents&mdash;from the beginning down to the passage in which
he says, "This is the commandment of the Lord to us, 'When
they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another;'<a name="FNanchor_1137_1137" id="FNanchor_1137_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a> and if
they persecute you in that also, flee ye to a third"&mdash;came
first into my hands, and to it I made a reply; and when this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
reply of ours had fallen, in turn, into his hands, he wrote in
answer to it this which I am now refuting, showing that he has
made no reply to mine. In that first portion, therefore, of his
writings to which I first replied, these are the passages of
Scripture which he conceives to be opposed to us: "Every
good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth
forth evil fruit. Do men gather grapes of thorns?"<a name="FNanchor_1138_1138" id="FNanchor_1138_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> And
again: "A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart,
bringeth forth good things; and an evil man, out of the evil
treasure, bringeth forth evil things."<a name="FNanchor_1139_1139" id="FNanchor_1139_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> And again: "When a
man is baptized by one that is dead, his washing profiteth
him nothing."<a name="FNanchor_1140_1140" id="FNanchor_1140_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> From these passages he is anxious to show
that the man who is baptized is made to partake of the character
of him by whom he is baptized; I, on the other hand,
have shown in what sense these passages should be received,
and that they could in no wise aid his view. But as for the
other expressions which he has used against evil and accursed
men, I have sufficiently shown that they are applicable to the
Lord's wheat, dispersed, as was foretold and promised, throughout
the world, and that they might rather be used by us against
you. Examine them again, and you will find it so.</p>

<p>62. But the passages which I have advanced to assert the
truth of the Catholic Church, are the following: As regards
the question of baptism, that our being born again, cleansed,
justified by the grace of God, should not be ascribed to the
man who administered the sacrament, I quoted these: "It is
better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man;"<a name="FNanchor_1141_1141" id="FNanchor_1141_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a>
and, "Cursed be the man that trusteth in man;"<a name="FNanchor_1142_1142" id="FNanchor_1142_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> and that,
"Salvation belongeth unto the Lord;"<a name="FNanchor_1143_1143" id="FNanchor_1143_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> and that, "Vain is
the help of man;"<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> and that, "Neither is he that planteth
anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the
increase;"<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> and that He in whom men believe justifieth the
ungodly, that his faith may be counted to him for righteousness.<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a>
But in behalf of the unity of the Church itself, which
is spread abroad throughout all the world, with which you do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
not hold communion, I urged that the following passages
were prophesied of Christ: that "He shall have dominion also
from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth;"<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a>
and, "I shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and
the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession;"<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> and
that the covenant of God made with Abraham may be quoted
in behalf of our, that is, of the Catholic, communion, in which
it is written, "In thy seed shall all nations of the earth be
blessed;"<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> which seed the apostle interprets, saying, "And
to thy seed, which is Christ."<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> Whence it is evident that
in Christ not only Africans or Africa, but all the nations
through which the Catholic Church is spread abroad, should
receive the blessing which was promised so long before.
And that the chaff is to be with the wheat even to the time
of the last winnowing, that no one may excuse the sacrilege
of his own separation from the Church by calumnious accusations
of other men's offences, if he shall have left or deserted
the communion of all nations; and to show that the society
of Christians may not be divided on account of evil ministers,
that is, evil rulers in the Church, I further quoted the
passage, "All whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe
and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say and
do not."<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a> With regard to these passages of holy Scripture
which I advanced to prove my points, he neither showed how
they ought to be otherwise interpreted, so as to prove that
they neither made for us nor against you, nor was he willing
to touch them in any way. Nay, his whole object was, could
it have been achieved, that by the tumultuous outpouring of
his abuse, it might never occur to any one at all, who after
reading my epistle might have been willing to read his as
well, that these things had been said by me.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. li.</span>&mdash;63. Next, listen for a short time to the kind of
way in which he has tried to use, in his own behalf, the
passages which I had advanced from the writings of the Apostle
Paul. "For you asserted," he says, "that the Apostle Paul finds
fault with those who used to say that they were of the Apostle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
Paul, saying, 'Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized
in the name of Paul?'<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> Wherefore, if they were in error, and
would have perished had they not been corrected, because they
wished to be of Paul, what hope can there possibly be for those
who have wished to be of Donatus? For this is their sole
object, that the origin, and root, and head of him that is baptized
should be none other than he by whom he is baptized."<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a>
These words, and this confirmation from the writings of the
apostle, he has quoted from my epistle, and he has proposed
to himself the task of refuting them. Go on then, I beg of
you, to see how he has fulfilled the task. For he says, "This
assertion is meaningless, and inflated, and childish, and foolish,
and something very far from a true exposition of our faith. For
you would only be right in asserting this, if we were to say,
We have been baptized in the name of Donatus, or Donatus
was crucified for us, or we have been baptized in our own name.
But since such things as this neither have been said nor are
said by us,&mdash;seeing that we follow the formula of the holy
Trinity,&mdash;it is clear that you are mad to bring such accusations
against us. Or if you think that we have been baptized in
the name of Donatus, or in our own name, you are miserably
deceived, and at the same time confess in your sacrilege that
you on your part defile your wretched selves in the name of
C√¶cilianus." This is the answer which Petilianus has made
to those arguments of mine, not supposing&mdash;or rather making
a noise that no one might suppose&mdash;that he has made no
answer at all which could bear in any way upon the question
which is under discussion. For who could fail to see that
this witness of the apostle has been adduced by us with all
the more propriety, in that you do not say that you were baptized
in the name of Donatus, or that Donatus was crucified
for you, and yet separate yourselves from the communion of
the Catholic Church out of respect to the party of Donatus;
as also those whom Paul was rebuking certainly did not
say that they had been baptized in the name of Paul, or that
Paul had been crucified for them, and yet they were making
a schism in the name of Paul. As therefore in their case,
for whom Christ, not Paul, was crucified, and who were bap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>tized
in the name of Christ, not of Paul, and who yet said,
"I am of Paul," the rebuke is used with all the more propriety,
"Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the
name of Paul?" to make them cling to Him who was crucified
for them, and in whose name they were baptized, and not
be guilty of division in the name of Paul; so in your case,
also, the rebuke, Was Donatus crucified for you? or were ye
baptized in the name of Donatus? is used all the more
appositely, because you do not say, We were baptized in the
name of Donatus, and yet desire to be of the party of
Donatus. For you know that it was Christ who was crucified
for you, and Christ in whose name you were baptized; and yet,
out of respect to the name and party of Donatus, you show
such obstinacy in fighting against the unity of Christ, who
was crucified for you, and in whose name you were baptized.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. lii.</span>&mdash;64. But if you wish to see that the object of
Petilianus in his writings really was to prove "that the
origin, and root, and head of him that is baptized is none
other than he by whom he is baptized," and that this has not
been asserted by me without meaning, or childishly, or foolishly,
review the beginning of the epistle itself to which I
made my reply, or rather pay careful attention to me as I
quote it. "The conscience," he says, "of one that gives in
holiness is what we look for to cleanse the conscience of the
recipient; for he who has received his faith from one that is
faithless, receives not faith but guilt." And as though some
one had said to him, Whence do you derive your proof of
this? he goes on to say, "For everything has its existence
from a source and root; and if anything has not a head, it is
nothing; nor does anything well confer a new birth, unless it
be born again of good seed. And this being so, brethren,
what perversity must it be to maintain that he who is guilty
by reason of his own offences should make another free from
guilt; whereas our Lord Jesus Christ says, 'A good tree
bringeth forth good fruit: do men gather grapes of thorns?'
And again, 'A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart,
bringeth forth good things; and an evil man, out of the evil
treasure, bringeth forth evil things.' And again, 'When a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
man is baptized by one that is dead, his washing profiteth him
nothing.'" You see to what end all these things tend, viz.
that the conscience of him that gives in holiness (lest any one,
by receiving his faith from one that is faithless, should receive
not faith but guilt) should be itself the origin, and root, and
head, and seed of him that is baptized. For, wishing to prove
that the conscience of one that gives in holiness is what we
look for to cleanse the conscience of the recipient, and that
he receives not faith but guilt, who wittingly receives his faith
from one that is faithless, he has added immediately afterwards,
"For everything has its existence from a source and
root; and if anything has not a head, it is nothing; nor does
anything well confer a new birth, unless it be born again of
good seed." And for fear that any one should be so dull as
still not to understand that in each case he is speaking of the
man by whom a person is baptized, he explains this afterwards,
and says, "This being so, brethren, what perversity
must it be to maintain that he who is guilty by reason of his
own offences should make another free from guilt; whereas
our Lord Jesus Christ says, 'A good tree bringeth forth good
fruit: do men gather grapes of thorns?'" And lest, by some
incredible stupidity of understanding, the hearer or seer
should be blind enough not to see that he is speaking of the
man that baptizes, he adds another passage, where he actually
specifies the man. "And again," he says, "'A good man, out
of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good things;
and an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil
things;' and again, 'When a man is baptized by one that is
dead, his washing profiteth him nothing.'" Certainly it is
now plain, certainly he needs no longer any interpreter, or
disputant, or demonstrator, to show that the object of his
party is to prove that the origin, and root, and head of him
that is baptized is none other than he by whom he is baptized.
And yet, being overwhelmed by the force of truth,
and as though forgetful of what he had said before, Petilianus
acknowledges afterwards to me that Christ is the origin and
root of them that are regenerate, and the Head of the Church,
and not any one that may happen to be the dispenser and
minister of baptism. For having said that the apostles used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
to baptize in the name of Christ, and set forth Christ as the
foundation of their faith, to make men Christians, and being
fain to prove this, too, by passages and examples from holy
Scripture, just as though we were denying it, he says, "Where
is now that voice, from which issued the noise of those minute
and constant petty questionings, wherein, in the spirit of envy
and self-conceit, you uttered many involved sayings about
Christ, and for Christ, and in Christ, in opposition to the rashness
and haughtiness of men? Lo, Christ is the origin, Christ
is the head, Christ is the root of the Christian." When,
therefore, I heard this, what could I do but give thanks to
Christ, who had compelled the man to make confession? All
those things, therefore, are false which he said in the beginning
of his epistle, when he wished to persuade us that the
conscience of one that gives in holiness must be looked for to
cleanse the conscience of the recipient; and that when one
has wittingly received his faith from one that is faithless, he
receives not faith but guilt. For, wishing as it were to show
clearly how much rested in the man that baptizes, he had
added what he seems to think most weighty proofs, saying,
"For everything has its existence from a source and root;
and if anything has not a head, it is nothing." But afterwards,
when he says what we also say, "Lo, Christ is the
origin, Christ is the head, Christ is the root of the Christian,"
he wipes out what he had said before, "that the conscience
of one that gives in holiness is the origin, and root, and head
of the recipient." The truth, therefore, has prevailed, so that
the man who is desirous to receive the baptism of Christ
should not rest his hope upon the man who administers the
sacrament, but should approach in all security to Christ Himself,
as to the source which is not changed, to the root which
is not plucked up, to the head which is not cast down.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. liii.</span>&mdash;65. Then who is there that could fail to perceive
from what a vein of conceit it proceeds, that in explaining
as it were the declaration of the apostle, he says, "He
who said, 'I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase,'
surely meant nothing else than this, that 'I made a
man a catechumen in Christ, Apollo baptized him; God con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>firmed
what we had done?'" Why then did not Petilianus
add what the apostle added, and I especially took pains to
quote, "So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither
he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase?"<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> And
if he be willing to interpret this on the same principle as
what he has set down above, it follows beyond all doubt, that
neither is he that baptizeth anything, but God that giveth the
increase. For what matter does it make in reference to the
question now before us, in what sense it has been said, "I
planted, Apollos watered,"&mdash;whether it is really to be taken
as equivalent to his saying, "I made a catechumen, Apollos
baptized him;" or whether there be any other more apposite
interpretation?&mdash;for in the mean time, according to his own
interpretation of the words, neither is he that makes the catechumen
anything, neither he that baptizes, but God that gives
the increase. But there is a great difference between confirming
what another does, and doing anything oneself. For He
who gives the increase does not confirm a tree or a vine, but
creates it. For by that increase it comes to pass that even a
piece of wood planted in the ground produces and establishes
a root; by that increase it comes to pass that a seed cast into
the earth puts forth a shoot. But why should we make a
longer dissertation on this point? It is enough that, according
to Petilianus himself, neither he that makes a catechumen,
nor he that baptizes, is anything, but God that gives the increase.
But when would Petilianus say this, so that we
should understand that he meant, Neither is Donatus of Carthage
anything, neither Januarius, neither Petilianus? When
would the swelling of his pride permit him to say this, which
now causes the man to think himself to be something, when
he is nothing, deceiving himself?<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. liv.</span>&mdash;66. Finally, again, a little afterwards, when he
resolved and was firmly purposed, as it were, to reconsider
once more the words of the apostle which we had brought up
against him, he was unwilling to set down this that I had
said, preferring something else in which by some means or
other the swelling of human pride might find means to breathe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
"For to reconsider," he says, "those words of the apostle, on
which you founded an argument against us; he said, 'What is
Apollos, what is Paul, save only ministers of Him in whom ye
have believed?'<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> What else, for example, does he say to all
of us than this, What is Donatus of Carthage, what is Januarius,
what is Petilianus, save only ministers of Him in whom ye
have believed?" I did not bring forward this passage of the
apostle, but I did bring forward that which he has been
unwilling to quote, "Neither he that planteth is anything,
neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase."
But Petilianus was willing to insert those words of the apostle,
in which he asks what is Paul, and what is Apollos, and
answers that "They are ministers of Him in whom ye have
believed." This the muscles of the heretic's neck could bear;
but he was wholly unable to endure the other, in which the
apostle did not ask and answer what he was, but said that he
was nothing. But now I am willing to ask whether it be
true that the minister of Christ is nothing. Who will say
so much as this? In what sense, therefore, is it true that
"Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth,
but God that giveth the increase," except that he who
is something in one point of view may be nothing in another?
For ministering and dispensing the word and sacrament he is
something, but for purifying and justifying he is nothing, seeing
that this is not accomplished in the inner man, except by
Him by whom the whole man was created, and who while He
remained God was made man,&mdash;by Him, that is, of whom it was
said, "Purifying their hearts by faith;"<a name="FNanchor_1157_1157" id="FNanchor_1157_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> and "To him that believeth
on Him that justifieth the ungodly."<a name="FNanchor_1158_1158" id="FNanchor_1158_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> And this testimony
Petilianus has been willing to set forth in my words,
whilst in his own he has neither handled it, nor even touched it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. lv.</span>&mdash;67. A minister, therefore, that is a dispenser
of the word and sacrament of the gospel, if he is a good man,
becomes a fellow-partner in the working of the gospel; but if
he is a bad man, he does not therefore cease to be a dispenser of
the gospel. For if he is good, he does it of his own free will;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
but if he is a bad man,&mdash;that is, one who seeks his own and
not the things of Jesus Christ,&mdash;he does it unwillingly, for the
sake of other things which he is seeking after. See, however,
what the same apostle has said: "For if I do this thing willingly,"
he says, "I have a reward; but if against my will, a
dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me;"<a name="FNanchor_1159_1159" id="FNanchor_1159_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1159_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> as though
he were to say, If I, being good, announce what is good, I
attain unto it also myself; but if, being evil, I announce it,
yet I announce what is good. For has he in any way said,
If I do it against my will, then shall I not be a dispenser
of the gospel? Peter and the other disciples announce the
good tidings, as being good themselves. Judas did it against
his will, but yet, when he was sent, he announced it in common
with the rest. They have a reward; to him a dispensation
of the gospel was committed. But they who received
the gospel at the mouth of all those witnesses, could not be
cleansed and justified by him that planted, or by him that
watered, but by Him alone that gives the increase. For
neither are we going to say that Judas did not baptize, seeing
that he was still among the disciples when that which is
written was being accomplished, "Jesus Himself baptized
not, but His disciples."<a name="FNanchor_1160_1160" id="FNanchor_1160_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1160_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> Are we to suppose that, because he
had not betrayed Christ, therefore he who had the bag, and
bare what was put therein,<a name="FNanchor_1161_1161" id="FNanchor_1161_1161"></a><a href="#Footnote_1161_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> was still enabled to dispense grace
without prejudice to those who received it, though he could
not be an upright guardian of the money entrusted to his
care? Or if he did not baptize, at any rate we must acknowledge
that he preached the gospel. But if you consider this a
trifling function, and of no importance, see what you must
think of the Apostle Paul himself, who said, "For Christ
sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel."<a name="FNanchor_1162_1162" id="FNanchor_1162_1162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1162_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> To this
we may add, that according to this, Apollos begins to be more
important, who watered by baptizing, than Paul, who planted
by preaching the gospel, though Paul claims to himself the
relation of father towards the Corinthians in virtue of this
very act, and does not grant this title to those who came to
them after him. For he says, "Though ye have ten thousand
instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers; for in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel."<a name="FNanchor_1163_1163" id="FNanchor_1163_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> He
says, "I have begotten you" to the same men to whom he
says in another place, "I thank God that I baptized none of
you but Crispus and Gaius, and I baptized also the household
of Stephanas."<a name="FNanchor_1164_1164" id="FNanchor_1164_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> He had begotten them, therefore, not through
himself, but through the gospel. And even though he had
been seeking his own, and not the things of Jesus Christ, and
had been doing this unwillingly, so as to receive no reward
for himself, yet he would have been dispensing the treasure of
the Lord; and this, though evil himself, he would not have
been making evil or useless to those who received it well.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. lvi.</span>&mdash;68. And if this is rightly said of the gospel,
with how much greater certainty should it be said of baptism,
which belongs to the gospel in such wise, that without it no
one can reach the kingdom of heaven, and with it only if
to the sacrament be added righteousness? For He who said,
"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God,"<a name="FNanchor_1165_1165" id="FNanchor_1165_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a> said Himself also, "Except
your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the
scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the
kingdom of heaven."<a name="FNanchor_1166_1166" id="FNanchor_1166_1166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> The form of the sacrament is given
through baptism, the form of righteousness through the gospel.
Neither one without the other leads to the kingdom of heaven.
Yet even men of inferior learning can baptize perfectly, but
to preach the gospel perfectly is a task of much greater difficulty
and rarity. Therefore the teacher of the Gentiles, that
was superior in excellence to the majority, was sent to preach
the gospel, not to baptize; because the latter could be done
by many, the former only by a few, of whom he was chief.
And yet we read that he said in certain places, "My gospel;"<a name="FNanchor_1167_1167" id="FNanchor_1167_1167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a>
but he never called baptism either his, or any one's else by
whom it was administered. For that baptism alone which
John gave is called John's baptism.<a name="FNanchor_1168_1168" id="FNanchor_1168_1168"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> This that man received
as the special pledge of his ministry, that the preparatory
sacrament of washing should even be called by the name of
him by whom it was administered; whereas the baptism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
which the disciples of Christ administered was never called
by the name of any one of them, that it should be understood
to be His alone of whom it is said, "Christ loved the
Church, and gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify and
cleanse it with the washing of water by the word."<a name="FNanchor_1169_1169" id="FNanchor_1169_1169"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> If, therefore,
the gospel, which is Christ's, but so that a minister also
may call it his in virtue of his office of administering it, can
be received by a man even at the hands of an evil minister
without danger to himself, if he does according to what he
says, and not after the example of what he does, how much
more may any one who comes in good faith to Christ receive
without fear of contagion from an evil minister the baptism of
Christ, which none of the apostles so administered as to dare
to call it his own?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. lvii.</span>&mdash;69. Furthermore, if, whilst I have continued
without intermission to prove how entirely the passages of
Scripture which Petilianus has quoted against us have failed to
hurt our cause, he himself has in some cases not touched at
all what I have quoted, and partly, when he has endeavoured
to handle them, has shown that the only thing that he could
do was to fail in finding an escape from them, you require no
long exhortation or advice in order to see what you ought
to maintain, and what you should avoid. But it may be that
this has been the kind of show that he has made in dealing
with the testimony of holy Scripture, but that he has not been
without force in the case of the documentary evidence found
in the records of the schism itself. Let us then see in the
case of these too, though it is superfluous to inquire into
them after testimony from the word of God, what he has
quoted, or what he has proved. For, after pouring forth a
violent invective against <i>traditors</i>, and quoting loudly many
passages against them from the holy books themselves, he yet
said nothing which could prove his opponents to be <i>traditors</i>.
But I quoted the case of Silvanus of Cirta, who held his own
see some little time before himself, who was expressly declared
in the Municipal Chronicles to have been a <i>traditor</i> while he
was yet a sub-deacon. Against this fact he did not venture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
to whisper a syllable. And yet you cannot fail to see how
strong the pressure was which must have been urging him to
reply, that he might show a man, who was his predecessor,
not only one of his party, but a partner, so to speak, in his
see, to have been innocent of the crime of delivering up the
sacred books, especially as you rest the whole strength of your
cause on the fact that you give the name of <i>traditor</i> to all
whom you either pretend or believe to have been the successors
of <i>traditors</i> in the path of their communion. Although, then,
the very exigencies of your cause would seem to compel him
to undertake the defence of a citizen even of Russicadia, or
Calama, or any other city of your party, whom I should declare
to be a <i>traditor</i>, on the authority of the Municipal
Chronicles, yet he did not open his mouth even in defence of
his own predecessor. For what reason, except that he could
not find any mist dark enough to deceive the minds of even
the slowest and sleepiest of men? For what could he have
said, except that the charges brought against Silvanus were
false? But we quote the words of the Chronicles, both as to
the date of the fact, and as to the time of the information laid
before Zenophilus the ex-consul.<a name="FNanchor_1170_1170" id="FNanchor_1170_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> And how could he resist
this evidence, being encompassed on every side by the most
excellent cause of the Catholics, whilst yours was bad as bad
could be? For which reason I quote these words from my
epistle to which he would fain be thought to have replied in
this which I am now refuting, that you may see for yourselves
how impregnable the position must be against which
he has been able to find no safer weapon than silence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. lviii.</span>&mdash;70. For when he quoted a passage from the
gospel as making against us, where our Lord says, "They
will come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are
ravening wolves: ye shall know them by their fruits,"<a name="FNanchor_1171_1171" id="FNanchor_1171_1171"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a>&mdash;I
answered and said, "Then let us consider their fruits;" and
then I at once went on to add the following words: "You
bring up against them their delivery of the sacred books.
This very charge we urge with greater probability against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
their accusers themselves. And not to carry our search too
far: in the same city of Constantina, your predecessors ordained
Silvanus bishop at the very outset of his schism. He,
while he was still a sub-deacon, was most unmistakeably
entered as a <i>traditor</i> in the archives of the city. If you, on
your side, bring forward documents against our predecessors,
all that we ask is equal terms, that we should either believe
both to be true, or both to be false. If both are true, you
are unquestionably guilty of schism, who have pretended that
you avoid offences in the communion of the whole world,
though these were common among you in your own fragmentary
sect. But again, if both are false, you are unquestionably
guilty of schism, who, on account of the false charges of
<i>traditors</i>, are staining yourselves with the heinous offence of
severance from the Church. But if we have something to
urge in accusation, while you have nothing, or if our charges
are true, whilst yours are false, it is no longer matter of discussion
how thoroughly your mouths are closed. What if
the holy and true Church of Christ were to convince and
overcome you, even if we held no documents in support
of our cause, or only such as were false, while you had possession
of some genuine proof of delivery of the sacred books,
what would then remain for you, except that, if you would,
you should show your love of peace, or otherwise should
hold your tongues? For whatever in that case you might
bring forward in evidence, I should be able to say with the
greatest ease and with the most perfect truth, that then you
are bound to prove as much to the full and Catholic unity of
the Church, already spread abroad and established throughout so
many nations, to the end that you should remain within, and
that those whom you convict should be expelled. And if you
have endeavoured to do this, certainly you have not been able
to make good your proof; and, being vanquished or enraged,
you have separated yourselves, with all the heinous guilt of
sacrilege, from the guiltless men who could not condemn on
insufficient proof. But if you have not even endeavoured to
do this, then with most accursed and unnatural blindness you
have cut yourselves off from the wheat of Christ, which grows
throughout His whole fields, that is, throughout the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
world until the end, because you have taken offence at a few
tares in Africa."<a name="FNanchor_1172_1172" id="FNanchor_1172_1172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> To this, which I have quoted from my
former epistle, Petilianus has made no answer whatsoever.
And, at all events, you see that in these few words is comprised
the whole question which is at issue between us. For
what should he endeavour to say, when, whatever course he
chose, he was sure to be defeated?</p>

<p>71. For when documents are brought forward relating to
the <i>traditors</i>, both by us against the men of your party, and
by you against the men of our party, (if indeed any really are
brought forward on your side, for to this very day we are left
in total ignorance of them; nor indeed can we believe that
Petilianus would have omitted to insert them in his letter,
seeing that he has taken so much pains to secure the quotation
and insertion of those portions of the Chronicles which
bear on the matter in opposition to me),&mdash;but still, as I began
to say, if such documents are brought forward both by us and
by you,&mdash;documents of whose existence we are wholly ignorant
to this very day,&mdash;surely you must acknowledge that either
both are true, or both false, or ours true and yours false, or
yours true and ours false; for there is no further alternative
that can be suggested.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. lix.</span>&mdash;But according to all these four hypotheses, the
truth is on the side of the communion of the Catholic Church.
For if both are true, then you certainly should not have deserted
the communion of the whole world on account of men
such as you too had among yourselves. But if both are false,
you should have guarded against the guilt of most accursed
division, which had not even any pretext to allege of any
delivery of the sacred books. If ours are true and yours are
false, you have long been without anything to say for yourselves.
If yours are true and ours are false, we have been
liable to be deceived, in common with the whole world, not
about the truth of the faith, but about the unrighteousness of
men. For the seed of Abraham, dispersed throughout the
world, was bound to pay attention, not to what you said you
knew, but to what you proved to the judges. Whence have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
we any knowledge of what was done by those men who were
accused by your ancestors, even if the allegations made
against them were true, so long as they were held to be not
true but false, either by the judges who took cognisance of
the case, or at least by the general body of the Church dispersed
throughout the world, which was only bound to pay
heed to the sentence of the judges? God does not necessarily
pardon any human guilt that others in the weakness of human
judgment fail to discover; yet I maintain that no one is
rightly deemed guilty for having believed a man to be innocent
who was not convicted. How then do you prove the
world to be guilty, merely because it did not know what possibly
was really guilt in the Africans,&mdash;its ignorance arising
either from the fact that no one reported the sin to it, or
from its having given credence, in respect of the information
which was given, rather to the judges who took cognisance of
the case, than to the murmurers who were defeated? So far,
then, Petilianus deserves all praise, in that, when he saw that
on this point I was absolutely impregnable, he passed it by in
silence. Yet he does not deserve praise for his attempts to
obscure in a mist of words other points which were equally
impregnable, which yet he thought could be obscured; or for
having put me in the place of his cause, when the cause left
him nothing to say; while even about myself he could say
nothing except what was either altogether false, or undeserving
of any blame, or without any bearing whatsoever upon me.
But, in the meantime, are you, whom I have made judges
between Petilianus and myself, possessed of discrimination
enough to decide in any degree between what is true and what
is false, between what is mere empty swelling and what is
solid, between what is troubled and what is calm, between
inflammation and soundness, between divine predictions and
human assumptions, between bringing an accusation and
establishing it, between proofs and fictions, between pleading
a cause and leading one away from it? If you have such
power of discrimination, well and good; but if you have it
not, we shall not repent of having bestowed our pains on you;
for even though your heart be not converted unto peace, yet
our peace shall return unto ourselves.</p>

THE HOLY GHOST.</small></p></blockquote>


<p class="cap">CHAP. I.&mdash;1. I must express my satisfaction, and congratulations,
and admiration, my son Boniface, in that, amid
all the cares of wars and arms, you are eagerly anxious to know
concerning the things that are of God. From hence it is clear
that in you it is actually a part of your military valour to
serve in truth the faith which is in Christ. To place, therefore,
briefly before your Grace the difference between the errors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
of the Arians and the Donatists, the Arians say that the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost are different in substance;
whereas the Donatists do not say this, but acknowledge the
unity of substance in the Trinity. And if some even of them
have said that the Son was inferior to the Father, yet they
have not denied that He is of the same substance; whilst the
greater part of them declare that they hold entirely the same
belief regarding the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost as
is held by the Catholic Church. Nor is this the actual question
in dispute with them; but they carry on their unhappy strife
solely on the question of communion, and in the perversity
of their error maintain rebellious hostility against the unity
of Christ. But sometimes, as we have heard, some of them,
wishing to conciliate the Goths, since they see that they are
not without a certain amount of power, profess to entertain
the same belief as they. But they are refuted by the authority
of their own leaders; for Donatus himself, of whose party
they boast themselves to be, is never said to have held this
belief.</p>

<p>2. Let not, however, things like these disturb thee, my
beloved son. For it is foretold to us that there must needs
be heresies and stumbling-blocks, that we may be instructed
among our enemies; and that so both our faith and our love
may be the more approved,&mdash;our faith, namely, that we should
not be deceived by them; and our love, that we should take
the utmost pains we can to correct the erring ones themselves;
not only watching that they should do no injury to the weak,
and that they should be delivered from their wicked error,
but also praying for them, that God would open their understanding,
and that they might comprehend the Scriptures. For
in the sacred books, where the Lord Christ is made manifest,
there is also His Church declared; but they, with wondrous
blindness, whilst they would know nothing of Christ Himself
save what is revealed in the Scriptures, yet form their notion
of His Church from the vanity of human falsehood, instead of
learning what it is on the authority of the sacred books.</p>

<p>3. They recognise Christ together with us in that which is
written, "They pierced my hands and my feet. I may tell
all my bones: they look and stare upon me. They part my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture;" and
yet they refuse to recognise the Church in that which follows
shortly after: "All the ends of the world shall remember, and
turn unto the Lord; and all the kindreds of the nations shall
worship before Thee. For the kingdom is the Lord's; and He
is the Governor among the nations."<a name="FNanchor_1174_1174" id="FNanchor_1174_1174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> They recognise Christ
together with us in that which is written, "The Lord hath
said unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten
Thee;" and they will not recognise the Church in that which
follows: "Ask of me, and I shall give Thee the heathen for
Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for
Thy possession."<a name="FNanchor_1175_1175" id="FNanchor_1175_1175"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> They recognise Christ together with us in
that which the Lord Himself says in the gospel, "Thus it
behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third
day;" and they will not recognise the Church in that which
follows: "And that repentance and remission of sins should
be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at
Jerusalem."<a name="FNanchor_1176_1176" id="FNanchor_1176_1176"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> And the testimonies in the sacred books are
without number, all of which it has not been necessary for
me to crowd together into this book. And in all of them, as
the Lord Christ is made manifest, whether in accordance with
His Godhead, in which He is equal to the Father, so that,
"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
God, and the Word was God;" or according to the humility
of the flesh which He took upon Him, whereby "the Word
was made flesh, and dwelt among us;"<a name="FNanchor_1177_1177" id="FNanchor_1177_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> so is His Church
made manifest, not in Africa alone, as they most impudently
venture in the madness of their vanity to assert, but spread
abroad throughout the world.</p>

<p>4. For they prefer to the testimonies of Holy Writ their
own contentions, because, in the case of C√¶cilianus, formerly a
bishop of the Church of Carthage, against whom they brought
charges which they were and are unable to substantiate, they
separated themselves from the Catholic Church,&mdash;that is, from
the unity of all nations. Although, even if the charges had
been true which were brought by them against C√¶cilianus, and
could at length be proved to us, yet, though we might pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>nounce
an anathema upon him even in the grave,<a name="FNanchor_1178_1178" id="FNanchor_1178_1178"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a> we are still
bound not for the sake of any man to leave the Church, which
rests for its foundation on divine witness, and is not the figment
of litigious opinions, seeing that it is better to trust in
the Lord than to put confidence in man.<a name="FNanchor_1179_1179" id="FNanchor_1179_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> For we cannot allow
that if C√¶cilianus had erred,&mdash;a supposition which I make
without prejudice to his integrity,&mdash;Christ should therefore
have forfeited His inheritance. It is easy for a man to believe
of his fellow-men either what is true or what is false; but it
marks abandoned impudence to desire to condemn the communion
of the whole world on account of charges alleged
against a man, of which you cannot establish the truth in the
face of the world.</p>

<p>5. Whether C√¶cilianus was ordained by men who had
delivered up the sacred books, I do not know. I did not see
it, I heard it only from his enemies. It is not declared to me
in the law of God, or in the utterances of the prophets, or
in the holy poetry of the Psalms, or in the writings of any
one of Christ's apostles, or in the eloquence of Christ Himself.
But the evidence of all the several scriptures with one accord
proclaims the Church spread abroad throughout the world,
with which the faction of Donatus does not hold communion.
The law of God declared, "In thy seed shall all the nations
of the earth be blessed."<a name="FNanchor_1180_1180" id="FNanchor_1180_1180"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a> The Lord said by the mouth of
His prophet, "From the rising of the sun, even unto the going
down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles;
and in every place incense shall be offered unto my
name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among
the heathen."<a name="FNanchor_1181_1181" id="FNanchor_1181_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> The Lord said through the Psalmist, "He
shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river
unto the ends of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_1182_1182" id="FNanchor_1182_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> The Lord said by His apostle,
"The gospel is come unto you, as it is in all the world, and
bringeth forth fruit."<a name="FNanchor_1183_1183" id="FNanchor_1183_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> The Son of God said with His own
mouth, "Ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost
part of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_1184_1184" id="FNanchor_1184_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a> C√¶cilianus, the bishop of the Church of
Carthage, is accused with the contentiousness of men; the
Church of Christ, established among all nations, is recommended
by the voice of God. Mere piety, truth, and love
forbid us to receive against C√¶cilianus the testimony of men
whom we do not find in the Church, which has the testimony
of God; for those who do not follow the testimony of God
have forfeited the weight which otherwise would attach to
their testimony as men.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ii.</span>&mdash;6. I would add, moreover, that they themselves,
by making it the subject of an accusation, referred the case of
C√¶cilianus to the decision of the Emperor Constantine; and
that, even after the bishops had pronounced their judgment,<a name="FNanchor_1185_1185" id="FNanchor_1185_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a>
finding that they could not crush C√¶cilianus, they brought
him in person before the above-named emperor for trial, in the
most determined spirit of persecution. And so they were
themselves the first to do what they censure in us, in order
that they may deceive the unlearned, saying that Christians
ought not to demand any assistance from Christian
emperors against the enemies of Christ. And this, too, they
did not dare to deny in the conference which we held at the
same time in Carthage: nay, they even venture to make it a
matter of boasting that their fathers had laid a criminal
indictment against C√¶cilianus before the emperor; adding
furthermore a lie, to the effect that they had there worsted
him, and procured his condemnation. How then can they be
otherwise than persecutors, seeing that when they persecuted
C√¶cilianus by their accusations, and were overcome by him,
they sought to claim false glory for themselves by a most
shameless lie; not only considering it no reproach, but glorying
in it as conducive to their praise, if they could prove that
C√¶cilianus had been condemned on the accusation of their
fathers? But in regard to the manner in which they were
overcome at every turn in the conference itself, seeing that
the records are exceedingly voluminous, and it would be a
serious matter to have them read to you while you are occu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>pied
in other matters that are essential to the peace of Rome,
perhaps it may be possible to have a digest<a name="FNanchor_1186_1186" id="FNanchor_1186_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> of them read to
you, which I believe to be in the possession of my brother
and fellow-bishop Optatus; or if he has not a copy, he might
easily procure one from the church at Sitifa; for I can well
believe that even that volume will prove wearisome enough
to you from its lengthiness, amid the burden of your many
cares.</p>

<p>7. For the Donatists met with the same fate as the accusers
of the holy Daniel.<a name="FNanchor_1187_1187" id="FNanchor_1187_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a> For as the lions were turned against
them, so the laws by which they had proposed to crush an
innocent victim were turned against the Donatists; save that,
through the mercy of Christ, the laws which seemed to be
opposed to them are in reality their truest friends; for through
their operation many of them have been, and are daily being
reformed, and return God thanks that they are reformed, and
delivered from their ruinous madness. And those who used
to hate are now filled with love; and now that they have
recovered their right minds, they congratulate themselves that
these most wholesome laws were brought to bear against them,
with as much fervency as in their madness they detested them;
and are filled with the same spirit of ardent love towards
those who yet remain as ourselves, desiring that we should
strive in like manner that those with whom they had been
like to perish might be saved. For both the physician is
irksome to the raging madman, and a father to his undisciplined
son,&mdash;the former because of the restraint, the latter
because of the chastisement which he inflicts; yet both are
acting in love. But if they were to neglect their charge, and
allow them to perish, this mistaken kindness would more truly
be accounted cruelty. For if the horse and mule, which have
no understanding, resist with all the force of bites and kicks
the efforts of the men who treat their wounds in order to cure
them; and yet the men, though they are often exposed to
danger from their teeth and heels, and sometimes meet with
actual hurt, nevertheless do not desert them till they restore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
them to health through the pain and annoyance which the
healing process gives,&mdash;how much more should man refuse
to desert his fellow-man, or brother to desert his brother, lest
he should perish everlastingly, being himself now able to comprehend
the vastness of the boon accorded to himself in his
reformation, at the very time that he complained of suffering
persecution?</p>

<p>8. As then the apostle says, "As we have therefore opportunity,
let us do good unto all men, not being weary in well-doing,"<a name="FNanchor_1188_1188" id="FNanchor_1188_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a>
so let all be called to salvation, let all be recalled
from the path of destruction,&mdash;those who may, by the sermons
of Catholic preachers; those who may, by the edicts of Catholic
princes; some through those who obey the warnings of God,
some through those who obey the emperor's commands. For,
moreover, when emperors enact bad laws on the side of falsehood
as against the truth, those who hold a right faith are
approved, and, if they persevere, are crowned; but when the
emperors enact good laws on behalf of the truth against falsehood,
then those who rage against them are put in fear, and
those who understand are reformed. Whosoever, therefore,
refuses to obey the laws of the emperors which are enacted
against the truth of God, wins for himself a great reward; but
whosoever refuses to obey the laws of the emperors which are
enacted in behalf of truth, wins for himself great condemnation.
For in the times, too, of the prophets, the kings who,
in dealing with the people of God, did not prohibit nor annul
the ordinances which were issued contrary to God's commands,
are all of them censured; and those who did prohibit and
annul them are praised as deserving more than other men.
And king Nebuchadnezzar, when he was a servant of idols,
enacted an impious law that a certain idol should be worshipped;
but those who refused to obey his impious command
acted piously and faithfully. And the very same king, when
converted by a miracle from God, enacted a pious and praiseworthy
law on behalf of the truth, that every one who should
speak anything amiss against the true God, the God of Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego, should perish utterly, with all
his house.<a name="FNanchor_1189_1189" id="FNanchor_1189_1189"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> If any persons disobeyed this law, and justly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
suffered the penalty imposed, they might have said what
these men say, that they were righteous, because they suffered
persecution through the law enacted by the king: and this
they certainly would have said, had they been as mad as these
who make divisions between the members of Christ, and
spurn the sacraments of Christ, and take credit for being persecuted,
because they are prevented from doing such things by
the laws which the emperors have passed to preserve the
unity of Christ; and boast falsely of their innocence, and
seek from men the glory of martyrdom, which they cannot
receive from our Lord.</p>

<p>9. But true martyrs are such as those of whom the Lord
says, "Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness'
sake."<a name="FNanchor_1190_1190" id="FNanchor_1190_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> It is not, therefore, those who suffer persecution
for their unrighteousness, and for the divisions which they
impiously introduce into Christian unity, but those who suffer
for righteousness' sake, that are truly martyrs. For Hagar
also suffered persecution at the hands of Sarah;<a name="FNanchor_1191_1191" id="FNanchor_1191_1191"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> and in that
case she who persecuted was righteous, and she unrighteous
who suffered persecution. Are we to compare with this persecution
which Hagar suffered the case of holy David, who
was persecuted by unrighteous Saul?<a name="FNanchor_1192_1192" id="FNanchor_1192_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> Surely there is an
essential difference, not in respect of his suffering, but because
he suffered for righteousness' sake. And the Lord Himself
was crucified with two thieves;<a name="FNanchor_1193_1193" id="FNanchor_1193_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> but those who were joined
in their suffering were separated by the difference of its
cause. Accordingly, in the psalm, we must interpret of the
true martyrs, who wish to be distinguished from false martyrs,
the verse in which it is said, "Judge me, O Lord, and distinguish<a name="FNanchor_1194_1194" id="FNanchor_1194_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a>
my cause from an ungodly nation."<a name="FNanchor_1195_1195" id="FNanchor_1195_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> He does not
say, Distinguish my punishment, but "Distinguish my cause."
For the punishment of the impious may be the same; but the
cause of the martyrs is always different. To whose mouth also
the words are suitable, "They persecute me wrongfully; help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
Thou me;"<a name="FNanchor_1196_1196" id="FNanchor_1196_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> in which the Psalmist claimed to have a right to
be helped in righteousness, because his adversaries persecuted
him wrongfully; for if they had been right in persecuting
him, he would have deserved not help, but correction.</p>

<p>10. But if they think that no one can be justified in using
violence,&mdash;as they said in the course of the conference that the
true Church must necessarily be the one which suffers persecution,
not the one inflicting it,&mdash;in that case I no longer urge
what I observed above; because, if the matter stand as they
maintain that it does, then C√¶cilianus must have belonged to
the true Church, seeing that their fathers persecuted him, by
pressing his accusation even to the tribunal of the emperor
himself. For we maintain that he belonged to the true Church,
not merely because he suffered persecution, but because he
suffered it for righteousness' sake; but that they were alienated
from the Church, not merely because they persecuted, but
because they did so in unrighteousness. This, then, is our
position. But if they make no inquiry into the causes for
which each person inflicts persecution, or for which he suffers
it, but think that it is a sufficient sign of a true Christian
that he does not inflict persecution, but suffers it, then beyond
all question they include C√¶cilianus in that definition, who
did not inflict, but suffered persecution; and they equally exclude
their own fathers from the definition, for they inflicted,
but did not suffer it.</p>

<p>11. But this, I say, I forbear to urge. Yet one point I
must press: If the true Church is the one which actually
suffers persecution, not the one which inflicts it, let them ask
the apostle of what Church Sarah was a type, when she inflicted
persecution on her handmaid. For he declares that
the free mother of us all, the heavenly Jerusalem, that is to
say, the true Church of God, was prefigured in that woman
who cruelly entreated her handmaid.<a name="FNanchor_1197_1197" id="FNanchor_1197_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> But if we investigate
the story further, we shall find that the handmaid rather persecuted
Sarah by her haughtiness, than Sarah the handmaid
by her severity: for the handmaid was doing wrong to her
mistress; the mistress only imposed on her a proper discipline
in her haughtiness. Again I ask, if good and holy men never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
inflict persecution upon any one, but only suffer it, whose
words they think that those are in the psalm where we read,
"I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them; neither
did I turn again till they were consumed."<a name="FNanchor_1198_1198" id="FNanchor_1198_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a> If, therefore,
we wish either to declare or to recognise the truth, there is a
persecution of unrighteousness, which the impious inflict upon
the Church of Christ; and there is a righteous persecution,
which the Church of Christ inflicts upon the impious. She
therefore is blessed in suffering persecution for righteousness'
sake; but they are miserable, suffering persecution for unrighteousness.
Moreover, she persecutes in the spirit of love,
they in the spirit of wrath; she that she may correct, they
that they may overthrow; she that she may recall from error,
they that they may drive headlong into error. Finally, she
persecutes her enemies and arrests them, until they become
weary in their vain opinions, so that they should make advance
in the truth; but they, returning evil for good, because we
take measures for their good, to secure their eternal salvation,
endeavour even to strip us of our temporal safety, being so in
love with murder, that they commit it on their own persons,
when they cannot find victims in any others. For in proportion
as the Christian charity of the Church endeavours to
deliver them from that destruction, so that none of them
should die, so their madness endeavours either to slay us, that
they may feed the lust of their own cruelty, or even to kill
themselves, that they may not seem to have lost the power of
putting men to death.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. iii.</span>&mdash;12. But those who are unacquainted with their
habits think that they only kill themselves now that all the
mass of the people are freed from the fearful madness of their
usurped dominion, in virtue of the laws which have been
passed for the preservation of unity. But those who know
what they were accustomed to do before the passing of the
laws, do not wonder at their deaths, but call to mind their
character; and especially how vast crowds of them used to
come in procession to the most frequented ceremonies of the
pagans, while the worship of idols still continued,&mdash;not with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
the view of breaking the idols, but that they might be put to
death by those who worshipped them. For if they had sought
to break the idols under the sanction of legitimate authority,
they might, in case of anything happening to them, have had
some shadow of a claim to be considered martyrs; but their
only object in coming was, that while the idols remained uninjured,
they themselves might meet with death. For it was
the general custom of the strongest youths among the worshippers
of idols, for each of them to offer in sacrifice to the
idols themselves any victims that he might have slain. Some
went so far as to offer themselves for slaughter to any travellers
whom they met with arms, using violent threats that they
would murder them if they failed to meet with death at their
hands. Sometimes, too, they extorted with violence from any
passing judge that they should be put to death by the executioners,
or by the officer of his court. And hence we have
a story, that a certain judge played a trick upon them, by
ordering them to be bound and led away, as though for execution,
and so escaped their violence, without injury to himself
or them. Again, it was their daily sport to kill themselves,
by throwing themselves over precipices, or into the water, or
into the fire. For the devil taught them these three modes of
suicide, so that, when they wished to die, and could not find
any one whom they could terrify into slaying them with his
sword, they threw themselves over the rocks, or committed
themselves to the fire or the eddying pool. But who can be
thought to have taught them this, having gained possession
of their hearts, but he who actually suggested to our Saviour
Himself, as a duty sanctioned by the law, that He should
throw Himself down from a pinnacle of the temple?<a name="FNanchor_1199_1199" id="FNanchor_1199_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> And his
suggestion they would surely have thrust far from them, had
they carried Christ, as their Master, in their hearts. But since
they have rather given place within them to the devil, they
either perish like the herd of swine, whom the legion of devils
drove down from the hill-side into the sea,<a name="FNanchor_1200_1200" id="FNanchor_1200_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a> or, being rescued
from that destruction, and gathered together in the loving
bosom of our Catholic mother Church, they are delivered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
brought to be healed of the devil, saying that ofttimes he was
wont to fall into the fire, and oft into the water.<a name="FNanchor_1201_1201" id="FNanchor_1201_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a></p>

<p>13. Whence it appears that great mercy is shown towards
them, when by the force of those very imperial laws they are
in the first instance rescued against their will from that sect
in which, through the teaching of lying devils, they learned
those evil doctrines, so that afterwards they might be made
whole in the Catholic Church, becoming accustomed to the
good teaching and example which they find in it. For many
of the men whom we now admire in the unity of Christ, for
the pious fervour of their faith, and for their charity, give
thanks to God with great joy that they are no longer in that
error which led them to mistake those evil things for good,&mdash;which
thanks they would not now be offering willingly, had
they not first, even against their will, been severed from
that impious association. And what are we to say of those
who confess to us, as some do every day, that even in the
olden days they had long been wishing to be Catholics; but
they were living among men among whom those who wished
to be Catholics could not be so through the infirmity of fear,
seeing that if any one there said a single word in favour of
the Catholic Church, he and his house were utterly destroyed
at once? Who is mad enough to deny that it was right that
assistance should have been given through the imperial decrees,
that they might be delivered from so great an evil, whilst those
whom they used to fear are compelled in turn to fear, and are
either themselves corrected through the same terror, or, at any
rate, whilst they pretend to be corrected, they abstain from
further persecution of those who really are, to whom they
formerly were objects of continual dread?</p>

<p>14. But if they have chosen to destroy themselves, in
order to prevent the deliverance of those who had a right to
be delivered, and have sought in this way to alarm the pious
hearts of the deliverers, so that in their apprehension that
some few abandoned men might perish, they should allow
others to lose the opportunity of deliverance from destruction,
who were either already unwilling to perish, or might have
been saved from it by the employment of compulsion; what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
is in this case the function of Christian charity, especially
when we consider that those who utter threats of their own
violent and voluntary deaths are very few in number in comparison
with the nations that are to be delivered? What
then is the function of brotherly love? Does it, because it
fears the shortlived fires of the furnace for a few, therefore
abandon all to the eternal fires of hell? and does it leave so
many, who are either already desirous, or hereafter are not
strong enough to pass to life eternal, to perish everlastingly,
while taking precautions that some few should not perish by
their own hand, who are only living to be a hindrance in the
way of the salvation of others, whom they will not permit to
live in accordance with the doctrines of Christ, in the hopes
that some day or other they may teach them too to hasten
their death by their own hand, in the manner which now
causes them themselves to be a terror to their neighbours, in
accordance with the custom inculcated by their devilish tenets?
or does it rather save all whom it can, even though those
whom it cannot save should perish in their own infatuation?
For it ardently desires that all should live, but it more especially
labours that not all should die. But thanks be to the
Lord, that both amongst us&mdash;not indeed everywhere, but in the
great majority of places&mdash;and also in the other parts of Africa,
the peace of the Catholic Church both has gained and is gaining
ground, without any of these madmen being killed. But
those deplorable deeds are done in places where there is an
utterly furious and useless set of men, who were given to such
deeds even in the days of old.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. iv.</span>&mdash;15. And indeed, before those laws were put in
force by the emperors of the Catholic faith, the doctrine of
the peace and unity of Christ was beginning by degrees to
gain ground, and men were coming over to it even from the
faction of Donatus, in proportion as each learned more, and
became more willing, and more master of his own actions;
although, at the same time, among the Donatists herds of abandoned
men were disturbing the peace of the innocent for one
reason or another in the spirit of the most reckless madness.
What master was there who was not compelled to live in dread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
of his own servant, if he had put himself under the guardianship
of the Donatists? Who dared even threaten one who sought
his ruin with punishment? Who dared to exact payment of
a debt from one who consumed his stores, or from any debtor
whatsoever, that sought their assistance or protection? Under
the threat of beating, and burning, and immediate death, all
documents compromising the worst of slaves were destroyed,
that they might depart in freedom. Notes of hand that had
been extracted from debtors were returned to them. Any one
who had shown a contempt for their hard words were compelled
by harder blows to do what they desired. The houses
of innocent persons who had offended them were either razed
to the ground or burned. Certain heads of families of honourable
parentage, and brought up with a good education, were
carried away half dead after their deeds of violence, or bound
to the mill, and compelled by blows to turn it round, after
the fashion of the meanest beasts of burden. For what assistance
from the laws rendered by the civil powers was ever of
any avail against them? What official ever ventured so much
as to breathe in their presence? What agents ever exacted
payment of a debt which they had been unwilling to discharge?
Who ever endeavoured to avenge those who were
put to death in their massacres? Except, indeed, that their
own madness took revenge on them, when some, by provoking
against themselves the swords of men, whom they obliged to
kill them under fear of instant death, others by throwing themselves
over sundry precipices, others by water, others by fire,
gave themselves over on the several occasions to a voluntary
death, and gave up their lives as offerings to the dead by
punishments inflicted with their own hands upon themselves.</p>

<p>16. These deeds were looked upon with horror by many
who were firmly rooted in the same superstitious heresy; and
accordingly, when they supposed that it was sufficient to establish
their innocence that they were ill contented with such
conduct, it was urged against them by the Catholics: If these
evil deeds do not pollute your innocence, how then do you
maintain that the whole Christian world has been polluted by
the alleged sins of C√¶cilianus, which are either altogether
calumnies, or at least not proved against him? How come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
you, by a deed of gross impiety, to separate yourselves from
the unity of the Catholic Church, as from the threshing-floor
of the Lord, which must needs contain, up to the time of the
final winnowing, both corn which is to be stored in the
garner, and chaff that is to be burned up with fire?<a name="FNanchor_1202_1202" id="FNanchor_1202_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a> And
thus some were so convinced by argument as to come over to
the unity of the Catholic Church, being prepared even to meet
the hostility of abandoned men; whilst the greater number,
though equally convinced, and though desirous to do the
same, yet dared not make enemies of these men, who were
so unbridled in their violence, seeing that some who had
come over to us experienced the greatest cruelty at their
hands.</p>

<p>17. To this we may add, that in Carthage itself some of the
bishops of the same party, making a schism among themselves,
and dividing the party of Donatus among the lower orders
of the Carthaginian people, ordained as bishop against bishop
a certain deacon named Maximianus, who could not brook
the control of his own diocesan. And as this displeased the
greater part of them, they condemned the aforesaid Maximianus,
with twelve others who had been present at his ordination,
but gave the rest that were associated in the same schism a
chance of returning to their communion on an appointed day.
But afterwards some of these twelve, and certain others of
those who had had the time of grace allowed to them, but
had only returned after the day appointed, were received by
them without degradation from their orders; and they did not
venture to baptize a second time those whom the condemned
ministers had baptized outside the pale of their communion.
This action of theirs at once made strongly against them on
the side of the Catholic party, so that their mouths were
wholly closed. And on the matter being diligently spread
abroad, as was only right, in order to cure men's souls of the
evils of schism, and when it was shown in every possible
direction by the sermons and discussions of the Catholic
divines, that to maintain the peace of Donatus they had not
only received back those whom they had condemned, with full
recognition of their orders, but had even been afraid to declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
that baptism to be void which had been administered outside
their Church by men whom they had condemned or even suspended;
whilst, in violation of the peace of Christ, they cast
in the teeth of all the world the stain conveyed by contact
with some sinners, it matters little with whom, and declared
baptism to be consequently void which had been administered
even in the very Churches whence the gospel itself had come
to Africa;&mdash;seeing all this, very many began to be confounded,
and blushing before what they saw to be mostly manifest
truth, they submitted to correction in greater numbers than
was their wont; and men began to breathe with a somewhat
freer sense of liberty from their cruelty, and that to a considerably
greater extent in every direction.</p>

<p>18. Then indeed they blazed forth with such fury, and
were so excited by the goadings of hatred, that scarcely any
churches of our communion could be safe against their
treachery and violence and most undisguised robberies; scarcely
any road secure by which men could travel to preach the
peace of the Catholic Church in opposition to their madness,
and convict the rashness of their folly by the clear enunciation
of the truth. They went so far, besides, in proposing hard
terms of reconciliation, not only to the laity or to any of the
clergy, but even in a measure to certain of the Catholic
bishops. For the only alternative offered was to hold their
tongues about the truth, or to endure their savage fury. But if
they did not speak about the truth, not only was it impossible
for any one to be delivered by their silence, but many were
even sure to be destroyed by their submitting to be led astray;
while if, by their preaching the truth, the rage of the Donatists
was again provoked to vent its madness, though some would
be delivered, and those who were already on our side would
be strengthened, yet the weak would again be deterred by fear
from following the truth. When the Church, therefore, was
reduced to these straits in its affliction, any one who thinks
that anything was to be endured, rather than that the assistance
of God, to be rendered through the agency of Christian
emperors, should be sought, does not sufficiently observe that
no good account could possibly be rendered for neglect of this
precaution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. v.</span>&mdash;19. But as to the argument of those men who
are unwilling that their impious deeds should be checked by
the enactment of righteous laws, when they say that the
apostles never sought such measures from the kings of the
earth, they do not consider the different character of that age,
and that everything comes in its own season. For what
emperor had as yet believed in Christ, so as to serve Him in
the cause of piety by enacting laws against impiety, when as
yet the declaration of the prophet was only in the course of
its fulfilment, "Why do the heathen rage, and the people
imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves,
and their rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and
against His Anointed;" and there was as yet no sign of that
which is spoken a little later in the same psalm: "Be wise
now, therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the
earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling."<a name="FNanchor_1203_1203" id="FNanchor_1203_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a>
How then are kings to serve the Lord with fear, except by
preventing and chastising with religious severity all those acts
which are done in opposition to the commandments of the
Lord? For a man serves God in one way in that he is man,
in another way in that he is also king. In that he is man, he
serves Him by living faithfully, but in that he is also king,
he serves Him by enforcing with suitable rigour such laws as
ordain what is righteous, and punish what is the reverse.
Even as Hezekiah served Him, by destroying the groves and
the temples of the idols, and the high places which had been
built in violation of the commandments of God;<a name="FNanchor_1204_1204" id="FNanchor_1204_1204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a> or even as
Josiah served Him, by doing the same things in his turn;<a name="FNanchor_1205_1205" id="FNanchor_1205_1205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a> or
as the king of the Ninevites served Him, by compelling all
the men of his city to make satisfaction to the Lord;<a name="FNanchor_1206_1206" id="FNanchor_1206_1206"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> or as
Darius served Him, by giving the idol into the power of
Daniel to be broken, and by casting his enemies into the den
of lions;<a name="FNanchor_1207_1207" id="FNanchor_1207_1207"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a> or as Nebuchadnezzar served Him, of whom I have
spoken before, by issuing a terrible law to prevent any of his
subjects from blaspheming God.<a name="FNanchor_1208_1208" id="FNanchor_1208_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a> In this way, therefore, kings
can serve the Lord, even in so far as they are kings, when they
do in His service what they could not do were they not kings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span></p>

<p>20. Seeing, then, that the kings of the earth were not yet
serving the Lord in the time of the apostles, but were still
imagining vain things against the Lord and against His
Anointed, that all might be fulfilled which was spoken by the
prophets, it must be granted that at that time acts of impiety
could not possibly be prevented by the laws, but were rather
performed under their sanction. For the order of events was
then so rolling on, that even the Jews were killing those who
preached Christ, thinking that they did God service in so
doing, just as Christ had foretold,<a name="FNanchor_1209_1209" id="FNanchor_1209_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a> and the heathen were
raging against the Christians, and the patience of the martyrs
was overcoming them all. But so soon as the fulfilment began
of what is written in a later psalm, "All kings shall fall down
before Him; all nations shall serve Him,"<a name="FNanchor_1210_1210" id="FNanchor_1210_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> what sober-minded
man could say to the kings, "Let not any thought trouble you
within your kingdom as to who restrains or attacks the Church
of your Lord; deem it not a matter in which you should be
concerned, which of your subjects may choose to be religious
or sacrilegious," seeing that you cannot say to them, "Deem it
no concern of yours which of your subjects may choose to be
chaste, or which unchaste?" For why, when free-will is given
by God to man, should adulteries be punished by the laws,
and sacrilege allowed? Is it a lighter matter that a soul
should not keep faith with God, than that a woman should be
faithless to her husband? Or if those faults which are committed
not in contempt but in ignorance of religious truth are
to be visited with lighter punishment, are they therefore to be
neglected altogether?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. vi.</span>&mdash;21. It is indeed better (as no one ever could
deny) that men should be led to worship God by teaching,
than that they should be driven to it by fear of punishment
or pain; but it does not follow that because the former course
produces the better men, therefore those who do not yield to
it should be neglected. For many have found advantage (as
we have proved, and are daily proving by actual experiment),
in being first compelled by fear or pain, so that they might
afterwards be influenced by teaching, or might follow out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
act what they had already learned in word. Some, indeed,
set before us the sentiments of a certain secular author, who
said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis well, I ween, by shame the young to train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dread of meanness, rather than by pain."<a name="FNanchor_1211_1211" id="FNanchor_1211_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is unquestionably true. But whilst those are better who
are guided aright by love, those are certainly more numerous
who are corrected by fear. For, to answer these persons out
of their own author, we find him saying in another place,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Unless by pain and suffering thou art taught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou canst not guide thyself aright in aught."<a name="FNanchor_1212_1212" id="FNanchor_1212_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, moreover, holy Scripture has both said concerning the
former better class, "There is no fear in love; but perfect
love casteth out fear;"<a name="FNanchor_1213_1213" id="FNanchor_1213_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> and also concerning the latter lower
class, which furnishes the majority, "A servant will not be
corrected by words; for though he understand, he will not
answer."<a name="FNanchor_1214_1214" id="FNanchor_1214_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a> In saying, "He will not be corrected by words,"
he did not order him to be left to himself, but implied an
admonition as to the means whereby he ought to be corrected;
otherwise he would not have said, "He will not be corrected
by words," but without any qualification, "He will not be
corrected." For in another place he says that not only the
servant, but also the undisciplined son, must be corrected with
stripes, and that with great fruits as the result; for he says,
"Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul
from hell;"<a name="FNanchor_1215_1215" id="FNanchor_1215_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1215_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a> and elsewhere he says, "He that spareth the rod
hateth his son."<a name="FNanchor_1216_1216" id="FNanchor_1216_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1216_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> For, give us a man who with right faith and
true understanding can say with all the energy of his heart,
"My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I
come and appear before God?"<a name="FNanchor_1217_1217" id="FNanchor_1217_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1217_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a> and for such an one there
is no need of the terror of hell, to say nothing of temporal
punishments or imperial laws, seeing that with him it is so
indispensable a blessing to cleave unto the Lord, that he not
only dreads being parted from that happiness as a heavy
punishment, but can scarcely even bear delay in its attainment.
But yet, before the good sons can say they have "a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
desire to depart, and to be with Christ,"<a name="FNanchor_1218_1218" id="FNanchor_1218_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1218_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a> many must first be
recalled to their Lord by the stripes of temporal scourging,
like evil slaves, and in some degree like good-for-nothing
fugitives.</p>

<p>22. For who can possibly love us more than Christ, who
laid down His life for His sheep?<a name="FNanchor_1219_1219" id="FNanchor_1219_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1219_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a> And yet, after calling
Peter and the other apostles by His words alone, when He
came to summon Paul, who was before called Saul, subsequently
the powerful builder of His Church, but originally its
cruel persecutor, He not only constrained him with His voice,
but even dashed him to the earth with His power; and that
He might forcibly bring one who was raging amid the darkness
of infidelity to desire the light of the heart, He first
struck him with physical blindness of the eyes. If that
punishment had not been inflicted, he would not afterwards
have been healed by it; and since he had been wont to see
nothing with his eyes open, if they had remained unharmed,
the Scripture would not tell us that at the imposition of
Ananias' hands, in order that their sight might be restored,
there fell from them as it had been scales, by which the sight
had been obscured.<a name="FNanchor_1220_1220" id="FNanchor_1220_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1220_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> Where is what the Donatists were wont
to cry: Man is at liberty to believe or not believe? Towards
whom did Christ use violence? Whom did He compel? Here
they have the Apostle Paul. Let them recognise in his case
Christ first compelling, and afterwards teaching; first striking,
and afterwards consoling. For it is wonderful how he who
entered the service of the gospel in the first instance under
the compulsion of bodily punishment, afterwards laboured
more in the gospel than all they who were called by word
only;<a name="FNanchor_1221_1221" id="FNanchor_1221_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1221_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> and he who was compelled by the greater influence of
fear to love, displayed that perfect love which casts out fear.</p>

<p>23. Why, therefore, should not the Church use force in
compelling her lost sons to return, if the lost sons compelled
others to their destruction? Although even men who have
not been compelled, but only led astray, are received by their
loving mother with more affection if they are recalled to her
bosom through the enforcement of terrible but salutary laws,
and are the objects of far more deep congratulation than those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
whom she had never lost. Is it not a part of the care of the
shepherd, when any sheep have left the flock, even though not
violently forced away, but led astray by tender words and
coaxing blandishments, to bring them back to the fold of his
master when he has found them, by the fear or even the pain of
the whip, if they show symptoms of resistance; especially since,
if they multiply with growing abundance among the fugitive
slaves and robbers, he has the more right in that the mark of
the master is recognised on them, which is not outraged in
those whom we receive but do not rebaptize? For the wandering
of the sheep is to be corrected in such wise that the
mark of the Redeemer should not be destroyed on it. For
even if any one is marked with the royal stamp by a deserter
who is marked with it himself, and the two receive forgiveness,<a name="FNanchor_1222_1222" id="FNanchor_1222_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1222_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a>
and the one returns to his service, and the other begins
to be in the service in which he had no part before, that mark
is not effaced in either of the two, but rather it is recognised
in both of them, and approved with the honour which is due
to it because it is the king's. Since then they cannot show
that the destination is bad to which they are compelled, they
maintain that they ought to be compelled by force even to
what is good. But we have shown that Paul was compelled
by Christ; therefore the Church, in trying to compel the
Donatists, is following the example of her Lord, though in the
first instance she waited in the hopes of needing to compel
no one, that the prediction of the prophet might be fulfilled
concerning the faith of kings and peoples.</p>

<p>24. For in this sense also we may interpret without absurdity
the declaration of the blessed Apostle Paul, when he
says, "Having in a readiness to avenge all disobedience, when
your obedience is fulfilled."<a name="FNanchor_1223_1223" id="FNanchor_1223_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1223_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a> Whence also the Lord Himself
bids the guests in the first instance to be invited to His great
supper, and afterwards compelled; for on His servants making
answer to Him, "Lord, it is done as Thou hast commanded,
and yet there is room," He said to them, "Go out into the
highways and hedges, and compel them to come in."<a name="FNanchor_1224_1224" id="FNanchor_1224_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1224_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a> In those,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
therefore, who were first brought in with gentleness, the former
obedience is fulfilled; but in those who were compelled, the
disobedience is avenged. For what else is the meaning of
"Compel them to come in," after it had previously said, "Bring
in," and the answer had been made, "Lord, it is done as Thou
commanded, and yet there is room?" If He had wished it to
be understood that they were to be compelled by the terrifying
force of miracles, many divine miracles were rather wrought
in the sight of those who were first called, especially in the
sight of the Jews, of whom it was said, "The Jews require a
sign;"<a name="FNanchor_1225_1225" id="FNanchor_1225_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1225_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a> and, moreover, among the Gentiles themselves the gospel
was so commended by miracles in the time of the apostles,
that had these been the means by which they were ordered
to be compelled, we might rather have had good grounds for
supposing, as I said before, that it was the earlier guests who
were compelled. Wherefore, if the power which the Church
has received by divine appointment in its due season, through
the religious character and the faith of kings, be the instrument
by which those who are found in the highways and
hedges&mdash;that is, in heresies and schisms&mdash;are compelled to
come in, then let them not find fault with being compelled, but
consider whether they be so compelled. The supper of the
Lord is the unity of the body of Christ, not only in the sacrament
of the altar, but also in the bond of peace. Of the
Donatists themselves, indeed, we can say that they compel
no man to any good thing; for whomsoever they compel, they
compel to nothing else but evil.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. vii.</span>&mdash;25. However, before those laws were sent into
Africa by which men are compelled to come in to the sacred
Supper, it seemed to certain of the brethren, of whom I was
one, that although the madness of the Donatists was raging
in every direction, yet we should not ask of the emperors to
ordain that heresy should absolutely cease to be, by sanctioning
a punishment to be inflicted on all who wished to live
in it; but that they should rather content themselves with
ordaining that those who either preached the Catholic truth
with their voice, or established it by their study, should no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
longer be exposed to the furious violence of the heretics. And
this they thought might in some measure be effected, if they
would take the law which Theodosius, of pious memory,
enacted generally against heretics of all kinds, to the effect
that any heretical bishop or clergyman, being found in any
place, should be fined ten pounds of gold, and confirm it in
more express terms against the Donatists, who denied that they
were heretics; but with such reservations, that the fine should
not be inflicted upon all of them, but only in those districts
where the Catholic Church suffered any violence from their
clergy, or from the Circumcelliones, or at the hands of any of
their people; so that, after a formal complaint had been made
by the Catholics who had suffered the violence, the bishops or
other ministers should forthwith be obliged, under the commission
given to the officers, to pay the fine. For we thought that
in this way, if they were terrified, and no longer dared do anything
of the sort, the Catholic truth might be freely taught
and held under such conditions, that while no one was compelled
to it, any one might follow it who was anxious to do
so without intimidation, so that we might not have false and
pretended Catholics. And although a different view was held
by other brethren, who either were more advanced in years,
or had experience of many states and places where we saw
the true Catholic Church firmly established, which had, however,
been planted and confirmed by God's great goodness at a
time when men were compelled to come in to the Catholic
communion by the laws of previous emperors, yet we carried
our point, to the effect that the measure which I have
described above should be sought in preference from the
emperors: it was decreed in our council,<a name="FNanchor_1226_1226" id="FNanchor_1226_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1226_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a> and envoys were
sent to the court of the count.</p>

<p>26. But God in His great mercy, knowing how necessary
was the terror inspired by these laws, and a kind of medicinal
inconvenience for the cold and wicked hearts of many
men, and for that hardness of heart which cannot be softened
by words, but yet admits of softening through the agency of
some little severity of discipline, brought it about that our
envoys could not obtain what they had undertaken to ask.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
For our arrival had already been anticipated by the serious
complaints of certain bishops from other districts, who had
suffered much ill-treatment at the hands of the Donatists
themselves, and had been thrust out from their sees; and, in
particular, the attempt to murder Maximianus, the Catholic
bishop of the Church of Bagai, under circumstances of incredible
atrocity, had caused measures to be taken which left our
deputation nothing to do. For a law had already been published,
that the heresy of the Donatists, being of so savage a
description that mercy towards it really involved greater
cruelty than its very madness wrought, should for the future
be prevented not only from being violent, but from existing
with impunity at all; but yet no capital punishment was imposed
upon it, that even in dealing with those who were
unworthy, Christian gentleness might be observed, but a
pecuniary fine was ordained, and sentence of exile was pronounced
against their bishops or ministers.</p>

<p>27. With regard to the aforesaid bishop of Bagai, in consequence
of his claim being allowed in the ordinary courts,
after each party had been heard in turn, in a basilica<a name="FNanchor_1227_1227" id="FNanchor_1227_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1227_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> of
which the Donatists had taken possession, as being the property
of the Catholics, they rushed upon him as he was standing
at the altar, with fearful violence and cruel fury, beat
him savagely with cudgels and weapons of every kind, and at
last with the very boards of the broken altar. They also
wounded him with a dagger in the groin so severely, that the
effusion of blood would have soon put an end to his life, had
not their further cruelty proved of service for its preservation;
for, as they were dragging him along the ground thus
severely wounded, the dust forced into the spouting vein
stanched the blood, whose effusion was rapidly on the way to
cause his death. Then, when they had at length abandoned
him, some of our party tried to carry him off with psalms;
but his enemies, inflamed with even greater rage, tore him
from the hands of those who were carrying him, inflicting
grievous punishment on the Catholics, whom they put to
flight, being far superior to them in numbers, and easily inspiring
terror by their violence. Finally, they threw him into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
a certain elevated tower, thinking that he was by this time
dead, though in fact he still breathed. Lighting then on a
soft heap of earth, and being espied by the light of a lamp
by some men who were passing by at night, he was recognised
and picked up, and being carried to a religious house,
by dint of great care, was restored in a few days from his
state of almost hopeless danger. Rumour, however, had carried
the tidings even across the sea that he had been killed
by the violence of the Donatists; and when afterwards he
himself went abroad, and was most unexpectedly seen to be
alive, he showed, by the number, the severity, and the freshness
of his wounds, how fully rumour had been justified in
bringing tidings of his death.</p>

<p>28. He sought assistance, therefore, from the Christian
emperor, not so much with any desire of revenging himself,
as with the view of defending the Church entrusted to his
charge. And if he had omitted to do this, he would have
deserved not to be praised for his forbearance, but to be
blamed for negligence. For neither was the Apostle Paul
taking precautions on behalf of his own transitory life, but
for the Church of God, when he caused the plot of those who
had conspired to slay him to be made known to the Roman
captain, the effect of which was, that he was conducted by
an escort of armed soldiers to the place where they proposed
to send him, that he might escape the ambush of his foes.<a name="FNanchor_1228_1228" id="FNanchor_1228_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1228_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a>
Nor did he for a moment hesitate to invoke the protection of
the Roman laws, proclaiming that he was a Roman citizen,
who at that time could not be scourged;<a name="FNanchor_1229_1229" id="FNanchor_1229_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1229_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a> and again, that he
might not be delivered to the Jews who sought to kill him,
he appealed to C√¶sar,<a name="FNanchor_1230_1230" id="FNanchor_1230_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1230_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a>&mdash;a Roman emperor, indeed, but not a
Christian. And by this he showed sufficiently plainly what
was afterwards to be the duty of the ministers of Christ, when
in the midst of the dangers of the Church they found the
emperors Christians. And hence, therefore, it came about
that a religious and pious emperor, when such matters were
brought to his knowledge, thought it well, by the enactment
of most pious laws, entirely to correct the error of this great
impiety, and to bring those who bore the standards of Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
against the cause of Christ into the unity of the Catholic
Church, even by terror and compulsion, rather than merely to
take away their power of doing violence, and to leave them
the freedom of going astray, and perishing in their error.</p>

<p>29. Presently, when the laws themselves arrived in Africa,
in the first place those who were already seeking an opportunity
for doing so, or were afraid of the raging madness of
the Donatists, or were previously deterred by a feeling of unwillingness
to offend their friends, at once came over to the
Church. Many, too, who were only restrained by the force of
custom handed down in their homes from their parents, but
had never before considered what was the groundwork of the
heresy itself,&mdash;had never, indeed, wished to investigate and contemplate
its nature,&mdash;beginning now to use their observation,
and finding nothing in it that could compensate for such
serious loss as they were called upon to suffer, became Catholics
without any difficulty; for, having been made careless by
security, they were now instructed by anxiety. But when all
these had set the example, it was followed by many who were
less qualified of themselves to understand what was the difference
between the error of the Donatists and Catholic truth.</p>

<p>30. Accordingly, when the great masses of the people had
been received by the true mother with rejoicing into her
bosom, there remained outside cruel crowds, persevering with
unhappy animosity in that madness. Even of these the
greater number communicated in feigned reconciliation, and
others escaped notice from the scantiness of their numbers.
But those who feigned conformity, becoming by degrees accustomed
to our communion, and hearing the preaching of
the truth, especially after the conference and disputation
which took place between us and their bishops at Carthage,
were to a great extent brought to a right belief. Yet in certain
places, where a more obstinate and implacable body prevailed,
whom the smaller number that entertained better views
about communion with us could not resist, or where the masses
were under the influence of a few more powerful leaders,
whom they followed in a wrong direction, our difficulties
continued somewhat longer. Of these places there are a few
in which trouble still exists, in the course of which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
Catholics, and especially the bishops and clergy, have suffered
many terrible hardships, which it would take too long to go
through in detail, seeing that some of them had their eyes
put out, and one bishop his hands and tongue cut off, while
some were actually murdered. I say nothing of massacres of
the most cruel description, and robberies of houses, committed
in nocturnal burglaries, with the burning not only of
private houses, but even of churches,&mdash;some being found abandoned
enough to cast the sacred books into the flames.</p>

<p>31. But we were consoled for the suffering inflicted on us
by these evils, by the fruit which resulted from them. For
wherever such deeds were committed by unbelievers, there
Christian unity has advanced with greater fervency and perfection,
and the Lord is praised with greater earnestness for
having deigned to grant that His servants might win their
brethren by their sufferings, and might gather together into
the peace of eternal salvation through His blood His sheep
who were dispersed abroad in deadly error. The Lord is
powerful and full of compassion, to whom we daily pray that
He will give repentance to the rest as well, that they may
recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, by whom
they are taken captive at his will,<a name="FNanchor_1231_1231" id="FNanchor_1231_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1231_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> though now they only
seek materials for calumniating us, and returning to us evil
for good; because they have not the knowledge to make them
understand what feelings and love we continue to have towards
them, and how we are anxious, in accordance with the injunction
of the Lord, given to His pastors by the mouth of the
prophet Ezekiel, to bring again that which was driven away,
and to seek that which was lost.<a name="FNanchor_1232_1232" id="FNanchor_1232_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1232_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. viii.</span>&mdash;32. But they, as we have sometimes said before
in other places, do not charge themselves with what they do
to us; while, on the other hand, they charge us with what
they do to themselves. For which of our party is there who
would desire, I do not say that one of them should perish, but
should even lose any of his possessions? But if the house of
David could not earn peace on any other terms except that
Absalom his son should have been slain in the war which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
was waging against his father, although he had most carefully
given strict injunctions to his followers that they should use
their utmost endeavours to preserve him alive and safe, that
his paternal affection might be able to pardon him on his repentance,
what remained for him except to weep for the son
that he had lost, and to console himself in his sorrow by reflecting
on the acquisition of peace for his kingdom?<a name="FNanchor_1233_1233" id="FNanchor_1233_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1233_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> The same,
then, is the case with the Catholic Church, our mother; for when
war is waged against her by men who are certainly different
from sons, since it must be acknowledged that from the great
tree, which by the spreading of its branches is extended over
all the world, this little branch in Africa is broken off, whilst
she is willing in her love to give them birth, that they may
return to the root, without which they cannot have the true
life, at the same time if she collects the remainder in so large a
number by the loss of some, she soothes and cures the sorrow of
her maternal heart by the thoughts of the deliverance of such
mighty nations; especially when she considers that those who
are lost perish by a death which they brought upon themselves,
and not, like Absalom, by the fortune of war. And if you
were to see the joy of those who are delivered in the peace
of Christ, their crowded assemblies, their eager zeal, the gladsomeness
with which they flock together, both to hear and
sing hymns, and to be instructed in the word of God; the
great grief with which many of them recall to mind their
former error, the joy with which they come to the consideration
of the truth which they have learned, with the indignation
and detestation which they feel towards their lying
teachers, now that they have found out what falsehoods they
disseminated concerning our sacraments; and how many of
them, moreover, acknowledge that they long ago desired to be
Catholics, but dared not take the step in the midst of men of
such violence,&mdash;if, I say, you were to see the congregations of
these nations delivered from such perdition, then you would
say that it would have been the extreme of cruelty, if, in the
fear that certain desperate men, in number not to be compared
with the multitudes of those who were rescued, might be
burned in fires which they voluntarily kindled for themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
these others had been left to be lost for ever, and to be tortured
in fires which shall not be quenched.</p>

<p>33. For if two men were dwelling together in one house,
which we knew with absolute certainty to be upon the point
of falling down, and they were unwilling to believe us when
we warned them of the danger, and persisted in remaining
in the house; if it were in our power to rescue them,
even against their will, and we were afterwards to show them
the ruin threatening their house, so that they should not
dare to return again within its reach, I think that if we abstained
from doing it, we should well deserve the charge of
cruelty. And further, if one of them should say to us, Since
you have entered the house to save our lives, I shall forthwith
kill myself; while the other was not indeed willing to
come forth from the house, nor to be rescued, but yet had not
the hardihood to kill himself: which alternative should we
choose,&mdash;to leave both of them to be overwhelmed in the ruin,
or that, while one at any rate was delivered by our merciful
efforts, the other should perish by no fault of ours, but rather
by his own? No one is so unhappy as not to find it easy
enough to decide what should be done in such a case. And
I have proposed the question of two individuals,&mdash;one, that is
to say, who is lost, and one who is delivered; what then must
we think of the case where some few are lost, and an innumerable
multitude of nations are delivered? For there are
actually not so many persons who thus perish of their own
free will, as there are estates, villages, streets, fortresses, municipal
towns, cities, that are delivered by the laws under consideration
from that fatal and eternal destruction.</p>

<p>34. But if we were to consider the matter under discussion
with yet greater care, I think that if there were a large number
of persons in the house which was going to fall, and any single
one of them could be saved, and when we endeavoured to
effect his rescue, the others were to kill themselves by jumping
out of the windows, we should console ourselves in our grief
for the loss of the rest by the thoughts of the safety of the
one; and we should not allow all to perish without a single
rescue, in the fear lest the remainder should destroy themselves.
What then should we think of the work of mercy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
which we ought to apply ourselves, in order that men may
attain eternal life and escape eternal punishment, if true reason
and benevolence compel us to give such aid to men, in order to
secure for them a safety which is not only temporal, but very
short,&mdash;for the brief space of their life on earth?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. ix.</span>&mdash;35. As to the charge that they bring against
us, that we covet and plunder their possessions, I would
that they would become Catholics, and possess in peace and
love with us, not only what they call theirs, but also what
confessedly belongs to us. But they are so blinded with the
desire of uttering calumnies, that they do not observe how
inconsistent their statements are with one another. At any
rate, they assert, and seem to make it a subject of most invidious
complaint among themselves, that we constrain them
to come in to our communion by the violent authority of the
laws,&mdash;which we certainly should not do by any means, if we
wished to gain possession of their property. What avaricious
man ever wished for another to share his possessions? Who
that was inflamed with the desire of empire, or elated by the
pride of its possession, ever wished to have a partner? Let
them at any rate look on those very men who once belonged
to them, but now are our brethren joined to us by the bond
of fraternal affection, and see how they hold not only what
they used to have, but also what was ours, which they did not
have before; which yet, if we are living as poor in fellowship
with poor, belongs to us and them alike; whilst, if we possess
of our private means enough for our wants, it is no longer
ours, inasmuch as we do not commit so infamous an act of
usurpation as to claim for our own the property of the poor,
for whom we are in some sense the trustees.</p>

<p>36. Everything, therefore, that was held in the name of
the churches of the party of Donatus, was ordered by the
Christian emperors, in their pious laws, to pass to the Catholic
Church, with the possession of the buildings themselves.<a name="FNanchor_1234_1234" id="FNanchor_1234_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1234_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a>
Seeing, then, that there are with us poor members of those
said churches who used to be maintained by these same paltry
possessions, let them rather cease themselves to covet what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
belongs to others whilst they remain outside, and so let them
enter within the bond of unity, that we may all alike administer,
not only the property which they call their own, but
also with it what is asserted to be ours. For it is written,
"All are yours; and ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's."<a name="FNanchor_1235_1235" id="FNanchor_1235_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1235_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a>
Under Him as our Head, let us all be one in His one body;
and in all such matters as you speak of, let us follow the
example which is recorded in the Acts of the Apostles:
"They were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of
them that ought of the things which he possessed was his
own; but they had all things common."<a name="FNanchor_1236_1236" id="FNanchor_1236_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1236_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> Let us love what
we sing: "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for
brethren to dwell together in unity!"<a name="FNanchor_1237_1237" id="FNanchor_1237_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1237_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a> that so they may know,
by their own experience, with what perfect truth their mother,
the Catholic Church, calls out to them what the blessed
apostle writes to the Corinthians: "I seek not yours, but
you."<a name="FNanchor_1238_1238" id="FNanchor_1238_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1238_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a></p>

<p>37. But if we consider what is said in the Book of
Wisdom, "Therefore the righteous spoiled the ungodly;"<a name="FNanchor_1239_1239" id="FNanchor_1239_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1239_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a> and
also what is said in the Proverbs, "The wealth of the sinner
is laid up for the just;"<a name="FNanchor_1240_1240" id="FNanchor_1240_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1240_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a> then we shall see that the question
is not, who are in possession of the property of heretics? but
who are in the society of the just? We know, indeed, that
the Donatists arrogate to themselves such a store of justice,
that they boast not only that they possess it, but that they
also bestow it upon other men. For they say that any one
whom they have baptized is justified by them, after which
there is nothing left for them but to say to the person who is
baptized by them, that he must needs believe on him who has
administered the sacrament; for why should he not do so,
when the apostle says, "To him that believeth on Him that
justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness?"<a name="FNanchor_1241_1241" id="FNanchor_1241_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1241_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a>
Let him believe, therefore, upon the man by whom he is
baptized, if it be none else that justifies him, that his faith
may be counted for righteousness. But I think that even
they themselves would look with horror on themselves, if they
ventured for a moment to entertain such thoughts as these.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
For there is none that is just and able to justify, save God
alone. But the same might be said of them that the apostle
says of the Jews, that "being ignorant of God's righteousness,
and going about to establish their own righteousness, they have
not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God."<a name="FNanchor_1242_1242" id="FNanchor_1242_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1242_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a></p>

<p>38. But far be it from us that any one of our number should
call himself in such wise just, that he should either go about
to establish his own righteousness, as though it were conferred
upon him by himself, whereas it is said to him, "For what
hast thou that thou didst not receive?"<a name="FNanchor_1243_1243" id="FNanchor_1243_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1243_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> or venture to boast himself
as being without sin in this world, as the Donatists themselves
declared in our conference that they were members of a
Church which has already neither spot nor wrinkle, nor any such
thing,<a name="FNanchor_1244_1244" id="FNanchor_1244_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1244_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a>&mdash;not knowing that this is only fulfilled in those individuals
who depart out of this body immediately after baptism,
or after the forgiveness of sins, for which we make petition in
our prayers; but that for the Church, as a whole, the time
will not come when it shall be altogether without spot or
wrinkle, or any such thing, till the day when we shall hear
the words, "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is
thy victory? The sting of death is sin."<a name="FNanchor_1245_1245" id="FNanchor_1245_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1245_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a></p>

<p>39. But in this life, when the corruptible body presseth
down the soul,<a name="FNanchor_1246_1246" id="FNanchor_1246_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1246_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> if their Church is already of such a character
as they maintain, they would not utter unto God the
prayer which our Lord has taught us to employ: "Forgive us
our trespasses."<a name="FNanchor_1247_1247" id="FNanchor_1247_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1247_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a> For since all sins have been remitted in
baptism, why does the Church make this petition, if already,
even in this life, it has neither spot nor wrinkle, nor any such
thing? They would also have a right to despise the warning
of the Apostle John, when he cries out in his epistle, "If we
say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth
is not in us. But if we confess our sins, He is faithful and
just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."<a name="FNanchor_1248_1248" id="FNanchor_1248_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1248_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a>
On account of this hope, the universal Church
utters the petition, "Forgive us our trespasses," that when He
sees that we are not vainglorious, but ready to confess our
sins, He may cleanse us from all unrighteousness, and that so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
the Lord Jesus Christ may show to Himself in that day a
glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing,
which now He cleanses with the washing of water in the word:
because, on the one hand, there is nothing that remains behind
in baptism to hinder the forgiveness of every bygone sin (so
long, that is, as baptism is not received to no effect without
the Church, but is either administered within the Church, or,
at least, if it has been already administered without, the recipient
does not remain outside with it); and, on the other
hand, whatever pollution of sin, of whatsoever kind, is contracted
through the weakness of human nature by those who
live here after baptism, is cleansed away in virtue of the same
laver's efficacy. For neither is it of any avail for one who
has not been baptized to say, "Forgive us our trespasses."</p>

<p>40. Accordingly, He so now cleanses His Church by the
washing of water in the word, that He may hereafter show it
to Himself as not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing,&mdash;altogether
beautiful, that is to say, and in absolute perfection,
when death shall be "swallowed up in victory."<a name="FNanchor_1249_1249" id="FNanchor_1249_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1249_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a> Now, therefore,
in so far as the life is flourishing within us that proceeds
from our being born of God, living by faith, so far we are
righteous; but in so far as we drag along with us the traces
of our mortal nature as derived from Adam, so far we cannot
be free from sin. For there is truth both in the statement
that "whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin,"<a name="FNanchor_1250_1250" id="FNanchor_1250_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1250_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a> and
also in the former statement, that "if we say that we have
no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."<a name="FNanchor_1251_1251" id="FNanchor_1251_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1251_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a>
The Lord Jesus, therefore, is both righteous and able to justify;
but we are justified freely by no other grace than His.<a name="FNanchor_1252_1252" id="FNanchor_1252_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1252_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a> For
there is nothing that justifieth save His body, which is the
Church; and therefore, if the body of Christ bears off the
spoils of the unrighteous, and the riches of the unrighteous
are laid up in store as treasures for the body of Christ, the
unrighteous ought not therefore to remain outside, but rather
to enter within, that so they may be justified.</p>

<p>41. Whence also we may be sure that what is written
concerning the day of judgment, "Then shall the righteous
man stand in great boldness before the face of such as have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
afflicted him, and made no account of his labours,"<a name="FNanchor_1253_1253" id="FNanchor_1253_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1253_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a> is not
to be taken in such a sense as that the Canaanite shall stand
before the face of Israel, though Israel made no account of the
labours of the Canaanite; but only as that Naboth shall stand
before the face of Ahab, since Ahab made no account of the
labours of Naboth, since the Canaanite was unrighteous, while
Naboth was a righteous man. In the same way the heathen
shall not stand before the face of the Christian, who made no
account of his labours, when the temples of the idols were
plundered and destroyed; but the Christian shall stand before
the face of the heathen, who made no account of his labours,
when the bodies of the martyrs were laid low in death. In
the same way, therefore, the heretic shall not stand in the
face of the Catholic, who made no account of his labours, when
the laws of the Catholic emperors were put in force; but the
Catholic shall stand in the face of the heretic, who made no
account of his labours, when the madness of the ungodly
Circumcelliones was allowed to have its way. For the passage
of Scripture decides the question in itself, seeing that it
does not say, Then shall men stand, but "Then shall the
righteous stand;" and they shall stand "in great boldness,"
because they stand in the power of a good conscience.</p>

<p>42. But in this world no one is righteous by his own
righteousness,&mdash;that is, as though it were wrought by himself
and for himself; but as the apostle says, "According as God
hath dealt to every man the measure of faith." But then he
goes on to add the following: "For as we have many members
in one body, and all members have not the same office; so we,
being many, are one body in Christ."<a name="FNanchor_1254_1254" id="FNanchor_1254_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1254_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a> And according to this
doctrine, no one can be righteous so long as he is separated
from the unity of this body. For in the same manner as if a
limb be cut off from the body of a living man, it cannot any
longer retain the spirit of life; so the man who is cut off from
the body of Christ, who is righteous, can in no wise retain the
spirit of righteousness, even if he retain the form of membership
which he received when in the body. Let them therefore
come into the framework of this body, and so possess
their own labours, not through the lust of lordship, but through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
the godliness of using them aright. But we, as has been
said before, cleanse our wills from the pollution of this concupiscence,
even in the judgment of any enemy you please
to name as judge, seeing that we use our utmost efforts in entreating
the very men of whose labours we avail ourselves to
enjoy with us, within the society of the Catholic Church, the
fruits both of their labours and of our own.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. x.</span>&mdash;43. But this, they say, is the very thing which
disquiets us,&mdash;If we are unrighteous, wherefore do you seek
our company? To which question we answer, We seek the
company of you who are unrighteous, that you may not remain
unrighteous; we seek for you who are lost, that we may rejoice
over you as soon as you are found, saying, This our
brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is
found.<a name="FNanchor_1255_1255" id="FNanchor_1255_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1255_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a> Why, then, he says, do you not baptize me, that you
might wash me from my sins? I reply: Because I do not
do despite to the stamp of the monarch, when I correct the
ill-doing of a deserter. Why, he says, do I not even do
penance in your body? Nay truly, except you have done
penance, you cannot be saved; for how shall you rejoice that
you have been reformed, unless you first grieve that you had
been astray? What, then, he says, do we receive with you,
when we come over to your side? I answer, You do not
indeed receive baptism, which was able to exist in you outside
the framework of the body of Christ, although it could
not profit you; but you receive the unity of the Spirit in the
bond of peace,<a name="FNanchor_1256_1256" id="FNanchor_1256_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1256_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a> without which no one can see God; and you
receive charity, which, as it is written, "shall cover the multitude
of sins."<a name="FNanchor_1257_1257" id="FNanchor_1257_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1257_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a> And in regard to this great blessing, without
which we have the apostle's testimony that neither the
tongues of men or of angels, nor the understanding of all
mysteries, nor the gift of prophecy, nor faith so great as to be
able to remove mountains, nor the bestowal of all one's goods
to feed the poor, nor giving one's body to be burned, can profit
anything;<a name="FNanchor_1258_1258" id="FNanchor_1258_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1258_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a> if, I say, you think this mighty blessing to be
worthless or of trifling value, you are deservedly but miserably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
astray; and deservedly you must necessarily perish, unless you
come over to Catholic unity.</p>

<p>44. If, then, they say, it is necessary that we should repent
of having been outside, and hostile to the Church, if we would
gain salvation, how comes it that after the repentance which
you exact from us we still continue to be clergy, or it may be
even bishops in your body? This would not be the case, as
indeed, in simple truth, we must confess it should not be the
case, were it not that the evil is cured by the compensating
power of peace itself. But let them give themselves this
lesson, and most especially let those feel sorrow in their hearts,
who are lying in this deep death of severance from the Church,
that they may recover their life even by this sort of wound
inflicted on our Catholic mother Church. For when the
bough that has been cut off is grafted in, a new wound is made
in the tree, to admit of its reception, that life may be given
to the branch which was perishing for lack of the life that is
furnished by the root. But when the newly-received branch
has become identified with the stock in which it is received,
the result is both vigour and fruit; but if they do not become
identified, the engrafted bough withers, but the life of the tree
continues unimpaired. For there is further a mode of grafting
of such a kind, that without cutting away any branch that
is within, the branch that is foreign to the tree is inserted,
not indeed without a wound, but with the slightest possible
wound inflicted on the tree. In like manner, then, when they
come to the root which exists in the Catholic Church, without
being deprived of any position which belongs to them as
clergy or bishops after ever so deep repentance of their error,
there is a kind of wound inflicted as it were upon the bark of
the mother tree, breaking in upon the strictness of her discipline;
but since neither he that planteth is anything, neither
he that watereth,<a name="FNanchor_1259_1259" id="FNanchor_1259_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1259_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a> so soon as by prayers poured forth to the
mercy of God peace is secured through the union of the
engrafted boughs with the parent stock, charity then covers
the multitude of sins.</p>

<p>45. For although it was made an ordinance in the Church,
that no one who had been called upon to do penance for any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
offence should be admitted into holy orders, or return to or
continue in the body of the clergy,<a name="FNanchor_1260_1260" id="FNanchor_1260_1260"></a><a href="#Footnote_1260_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a> this was done not to cause
despair of any indulgence being granted, but merely to maintain
a rigorous discipline; otherwise an argument will be
raised against the keys that were given to the Church, of
which we have the testimony of Scripture: "Whatsoever thou
shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_1261_1261" id="FNanchor_1261_1261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1261_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> But lest it
should so happen that, after the detection of offences, a heart
swelling with the hope of ecclesiastical preferment might do
penance in a spirit of pride, it was determined, with great
severity, that after doing penance for any mortal sin, no one
should be admitted to the number of the clergy, in order that,
when all hope of temporal preferment was done away, the
medicine of humility might be endowed with greater strength
and truth. For even the holy David did penance for deadly
sin, and yet was not degraded from his office. And we know
that the blessed Peter, after shedding the bitterest of tears,
repented that he had denied his Lord, and yet remained an
apostle. But we must not therefore be induced to think that
the care of those in later times was in any way superfluous,
who, when there was no risk of endangering salvation, added
something to humiliation, in order that the salvation might be
more thoroughly protected,&mdash;having, I suppose, experienced a
feigned repentance on the part of some who were influenced
by the desire of the power attaching to office. For experience
in many diseases necessarily brings in the invention of many
remedies. But in cases of this kind, when, owing to the
serious ruptures of dissensions in the Church, it is no longer
a question of danger to this or that particular individual, but
whole nations are lying in ruin, it is right to yield a little
from our severity, that true charity may give her aid in healing
the more serious evils.</p>

<p>46. Let them therefore feel bitter grief for their detestable
error of the past, as Peter did for his fear that led him into
falsehood, and let them come to the true Church of Christ,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
that is, to the Catholic Church our mother; let them be in it
clergy, let them be bishops unto its profit, as they have been
hitherto in enmity against it. We feel no jealousy towards
them, nay, we embrace them; we wish, we advise, we even
compel those to come in whom we find in the highways and
hedges, although we fail as yet in persuading some of them
that we are seeking not their property, but themselves. The
Apostle Peter, when he denied his Saviour, and wept, and did
not cease to be an apostle, had not as yet received the Holy
Spirit that was promised; but much more have these men not
received Him, when, being severed from the framework of the
body, which is alone enlivened by the Holy Spirit, they have
usurped the sacraments of the Church outside the Church and
in hostility to the Church, and have fought against us in a
kind of civil war, with our own arms and our own standards
raised in opposition to us. Let them come; let peace be concluded
in the virtue of Jerusalem, which virtue is Christian
charity,&mdash;to which holy city it is said, "Peace be in thy virtue,
and plenteousness within thy palaces."<a name="FNanchor_1262_1262" id="FNanchor_1262_1262"></a><a href="#Footnote_1262_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> Let them not exalt
themselves against the solicitude of their mother, which she
both has entertained and does entertain with the object of
gathering within her bosom themselves, and all the mighty
nations whom they are, or recently were, deceiving; let them not
be puffed up with pride, that she receives them in such wise;
let them not attribute to the evil of their own exaltation the
good which she on her part does in order to make peace.</p>

<p>47. So it has been her wont to come to the aid of multitudes
who were perishing through schisms and heresies. This
displeased Lucifer,<a name="FNanchor_1263_1263" id="FNanchor_1263_1263"></a><a href="#Footnote_1263_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a> when it was carried out in receiving and
healing those who had perished beneath the poison of the Arian
heresy; and, being displeased at it, he fell into the darkness of
schism, losing the light of Christian charity. In accordance
with this principle, the Church of Africa has recognised the
Donatists from the very beginning, obeying herein the decree
of the bishops who gave sentence in the Church at Rome
between C√¶cilianus and the party of Donatus; and having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
condemned one bishop named Donatus,<a name="FNanchor_1264_1264" id="FNanchor_1264_1264"></a><a href="#Footnote_1264_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a> who was proved to
have been the author of the schism, they determined that the
others should be received, after correction, with full recognition
of their orders, even if they had been ordained outside
the Church,&mdash;not that they could have the Holy Spirit even
outside the unity of the body of Christ, but, in the first place,
for the sake of those whom it was possible they might deceive
while they remained outside, and prevent from obtaining
that gift; and, secondly, that their own weakness also being
mercifully received within, might thus be rendered capable of
cure, no obstinacy any longer standing in the way to close
their eyes against the evidence of truth. For what other
intention could have given rise to their own conduct, when
they received with full recognition of their orders the followers
of Maximianus, whom they had condemned as guilty of sacrilegious
schism, as their council<a name="FNanchor_1265_1265" id="FNanchor_1265_1265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1265_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a> shows, and to fill whose places
they had already ordained other men, when they saw that the
people did not depart from their company, that all might not
be involved in ruin? And on what other ground did they
neither speak against nor question the validity of the baptism
which had been administered outside by men whom they had
condemned? Why, then, do they wonder, why do they complain,
and make it the subject of their calumnies, that we
receive them in such wise to promote the true peace of Christ,
while yet they do not remember what they themselves have
done to promote the false peace of Donatus, which is opposed
to Christ? For if this act of theirs be borne in mind, and
intelligently used in argument against them, they will have
no answer whatsoever that they can make.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chap. xi.</span>&mdash;48. But as to what they say, arguing as follows:
If we have sinned against the Holy Ghost, in that we
have treated your baptism with contempt, why is it that you
seek us, seeing that we cannot possibly receive remission of
this sin, as the Lord says, "Whosoever speaketh against the
Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world,
neither in the world to come?"<a name="FNanchor_1266_1266" id="FNanchor_1266_1266"></a><a href="#Footnote_1266_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a>&mdash;they do not perceive that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
according to their interpretation of the passage none can be
delivered. For who is there that does not speak against the
Holy Ghost and sin against Him, whether we take the case of
one who is not yet a Christian, or of one who shares in the
heresy of Arius, or of Eunomius, or of Macedonius, who all say
that He is a creature; or of Photinus, who denies that He
has any substance at all, saying that there is only one God,
the Father; or of any of the other heretics, whom it would
now take too long a time to mention in detail? Are none,
therefore, of these to be delivered? Or if the Jews themselves,
against whom the Lord directed His reproach, were to
believe in Him, would they not be allowed to be baptized? for
the Saviour does not say, Shall be forgiven in baptism; but
"Shall not be forgiven, neither in this world, neither in the
world to come."</p>

<p>49. Let them understand, therefore, that it is not every sin,
but only some sin, against the Holy Ghost which is incapable
of forgiveness. For just as when our Lord said, "If I had not
come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin,"<a name="FNanchor_1267_1267" id="FNanchor_1267_1267"></a><a href="#Footnote_1267_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a> it is clear
that He did not wish it to be understood that they would
have been free from all sin, since they were filled with many
grievous sins, but that they would have been free from some
special sin, the absence of which would have left them in a
position to receive remission of all the sins which yet remained
in them, viz. the sin of not believing in Him when He came
to them; for they could not have had this sin, had He not
come. In like manner, also, when He said, "Whosoever
sinneth against the Holy Ghost," or, "Whosoever speaketh
against the Holy Ghost;" it is clear that He does not refer to
every sin of whatsoever kind against the Holy Ghost, in word
or deed, but would have us understand some special and
peculiar sin. But this is the hardness of heart even to the end
of this life, which leads a man to refuse to accept remission of
his sins in the unity of the body of Christ, to which life is
given by the Holy Ghost. For when He had said to His
disciples, "Receive the Holy Ghost," He immediately added,
"Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them;
and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained."<a name="FNanchor_1268_1268" id="FNanchor_1268_1268"></a><a href="#Footnote_1268_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a> Whoso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>ever
therefore has resisted or fought against this gift of the
grace of God, or has been estranged from it in any way whatever
to the end of this mortal life, shall not receive the remission
of that sin, either in this world, or in the world to come,
seeing that it is so great a sin that in it is included every sin;
but it cannot be proved to have been committed by any one,
till he has passed away from life. But so long as he lives
here, "the goodness of God," as the apostle says, "is leading
him to repentance;" but if he deliberately, with the utmost
perseverance in iniquity, as the apostle adds in the succeeding
verse, "after his hardness and impenitent heart, treasures up
unto himself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of
the righteous judgment of God,"<a name="FNanchor_1269_1269" id="FNanchor_1269_1269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1269_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> he shall not receive forgiveness,
neither in this world, neither in that which is to come.</p>

<p>50. But those with whom we are arguing, or about whom
we are arguing, are not to be despaired of, for they are yet in
the body; but they cannot seek the Holy Spirit, except in the
body of Christ, of which they possess the outward sign outside
the Church, but they do not possess the actual reality itself
within the Church of which that is the outward sign, and
therefore they eat and drink damnation to themselves.<a name="FNanchor_1270_1270" id="FNanchor_1270_1270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1270_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a> For
there is but one bread which is the sacrament of unity, seeing
that, as the apostle says, "We, being many, are one bread, and
one body."<a name="FNanchor_1271_1271" id="FNanchor_1271_1271"></a><a href="#Footnote_1271_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a> Furthermore, the Catholic Church alone is the
body of Christ, of which He is the Head and Saviour of His
body.<a name="FNanchor_1272_1272" id="FNanchor_1272_1272"></a><a href="#Footnote_1272_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a> Outside this body the Holy Spirit giveth life to no
one, seeing that, as the apostle says himself, "The love of God
is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given
unto us;"<a name="FNanchor_1273_1273" id="FNanchor_1273_1273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1273_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a> but he is not a partaker of the divine love who
is the enemy of unity. Therefore they have not the Holy
Ghost who are outside the Church; for it is written of them,
"They separate themselves, being sensual, having not the
Spirit."<a name="FNanchor_1274_1274" id="FNanchor_1274_1274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1274_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a> But neither does he receive it who is insincerely
in the Church, since this is also the intent of what is written:
"For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee deceit."<a name="FNanchor_1275_1275" id="FNanchor_1275_1275"></a><a href="#Footnote_1275_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a> If any
one, therefore, wishes to receive the Holy Spirit, let him beware
of continuing in alienation from the Church, let him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
beware of entering it in the spirit of dissimulation; or if he
has already entered it in such wise, let him beware of persisting
in such dissimulation, in order that he may truly and
indeed become united with the tree of life.</p>

<p>51. I have despatched to you a somewhat lengthy epistle,
which may prove burdensome among your many occupations.
If, therefore, it may be read to you even in portions, the Lord
will grant you understanding, that you may have some answer
which you can make for the correction and healing of those
men who are commended to you as to a faithful son by our
mother the Church, that you may correct and heal them,
wherever you can, and howsoever you can, either by speaking
and replying to them in your own person, or by bringing
them into communication with the doctors of the Church.</p>

<p>MESSRS. CLARK are now happy to announce the near completion of this
Series. It has been received with marked approval by all sections of the
Christian Church in this country and in the United States, as supplying what
has long been felt to be a want, and also on account of the impartiality, learning,

Twenty-two are ready, and the remaining Two will be published as early as

will cost Six Guineas.</p>

this work, was either that of Arles, in 314 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, or of Nic√¶a, in 325 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, both
of them being before his birth, in 354 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> He quotes the decision of the same
council, <i>contra Parmenianum</i>, ii. 13, 30; <i>de H&oelig;resibus</i>, 69; <i>Ep.</i> xliii. 7, 19.
Migne brings forward the following passages in favour of its being the Council
of Arles to which Augustine refers, since in them he ascribes the decision of
the controversy to "the authority of the whole world." <i>Contra Parmenianum</i>,
iii. 4, 21: "They condemned," he says, "some few in Africa, by whom they
were in turn vanquished by the judgment of the whole world;" and he adds,
that "the Catholics trusted ecclesiastical judges like these in preference to
the defeated parties in the suit." <i>Ib.</i> 6, 30: He says that the Donatists,
"having made a schism in the unity of the Church, were refuted, not by the
authority of 310 African bishops, but by that of the whole world." And in the
sixth chapter of the first book of the same treatise, he says that the Donatists,
after the decision at Arles, came again to Constantine, and there were defeated
"by a final decision," <i>i.e.</i> at Milan, as is seen from <i>Ep.</i> xliii. 7, 20, in the year
316 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span></p></div>

pr√¶ferendum putamus." This does not suit the sense of the passage, and
probably sprung from want of knowledge of the meaning of the "catechumen's
sacrament." It is mentioned in the third Council of Carthage as "the sacrament
of salt" (Conc. Carth. 3, can. 5). Augustine (<i>de Peccat. Meritis</i>, ii. c.
26) says that "what the catechumens receive, though it be not the body of
Christ, yet is holy, more holy than the food whereby our bodies are sustained,
because it is a sacrament."&mdash;Cp. <i>de Catech. Rudibus</i>, c. 26. It appears to have
been only a taste of salt, given them as the emblem of purity and incorruption.

the end of John iii. 6 in the oldest Latin <span class="smcap">MS.</span> (in the Bodleian Library), and their
meaning appears to be, as given in the text, that whatsoever is born of the Spirit
is spirit, since the Holy Ghost, being God, and born of, or proceeding from God,
in virtue of His supreme power makes those to be spirits whom He regenerates.
If the meaning had been (as Bishop Fell takes it), that "he who is born of the
Spirit is born of God," the neuter "de Deo natum est" would have been required.
To refer "Spiritus Deus est," with Migne, to John iv. 24, "God is a Spirit,"
reverses the grammar and destroys the sense of the passage. The above explanation
is taken from the preface to Cyprian by the monk of St. Maur (Maranus),
p. xxxvi., quoted by Routh, <i>Rel. Sac.</i> iii. 193.</p></div>

this Council, and consequently the letter to Stephen, was subsequent to the
Council under consideration; and consequently Augustine is right in ignoring
it, and referring solely to the former. Dr. Routh thinks the words an interpolation,
of course before Augustine's time; and they may perhaps have been
inserted by some one who had Cyprian's later letter to Stephen before his mind.</p></div>

of this last passage to be, not as Cyprian took it, <i>Ep.</i> liv. sec. 2, that the vessels
of gold and silver are the good, which are to honour; the vessels of wood and
earth the wicked, which are to dishonour: but that the material of the vessels
refers to the outward appearance of the several members of the Church, and that
in each class some will be found to honour, and some to dishonour. This interpretation
he derives from Tychonius.</p></div>

however, forbidden them to sacrifice the Passover except in the place which the

observe the other paschal solemnities, abstain from the sacrifice of the lamb.</p></div>

Antoninus Heliogabalus, of whom Lampridius asserts that he derived the name

against Parmenianus. Of Ursacius he says in the same place: "You are offended
at the times of a certain Leontius, of Ursacius, Macarius, and others." And
Augustine, in his third book against Cresconius, c. xx., introduces an objection
of the Donatists against himself: "But so soon as Silvanus, bishop of Cirta,
had refused to communicate with Ursacius and Zenophilus the persecutors, he
was driven into exile," Usuardus, deceived by a false story made up by the
Donatists, enters in his Martyrology that a pseudo-martyr Donatus suffered on
the 1st of March, under Ursacius and Marcellinus, to this effect: "On the same
day of the holy martyr Donatus, who suffered under Ursacius the judge and the
tribune Marcellinus."</p></div>

"Do ye not know that the words of the king were, 'I thought it good to show
the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me. How great
are His signs! and how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting
kingdom, and His dominion from generation to generation' (Dan. iv. 2, 3)? Do
you not, when you hear this, answer <i>Amen</i>, and by saying this in a loud voice,
place your seal on the king's decree by a holy and solemn act?" In the Gothic
liturgy this declaration was made on Easter Eve (when the third chapter of
Daniel is still read in the Roman Church), and the people answered "<i>Amen</i>."</p></div>
